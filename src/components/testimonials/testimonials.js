				In the following testimonials, the new name MycorrPlus has been
				substituted for the name GroPal Balance.

				<h2>Elaine – Grass Hay and Pasture (Northern Florida)</h2>
				<p>
					We applied 40 ounces of MycorrPlus A the first of June. The first of
					August I saw that our hay had an additional 3" of growth. A friend of
					mine looked at our hayfield and was amazed—he wanted to know what we
					did because, with the hot, dry conditions over the past couple of
					months, other hay fields in the area had shown little or no growth. In
					fact, they had turned brown and dry. Not only is our hay field still
					green all the way down to the root, but the grass is healthier and
					stronger.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we are seeing is that the pasture is beginning to thicken. A
					friend of ours, who has had the same amount of rain, has run out of
					grass and is feeding hay, while we have more grass than we can
					actually use for our cattle.
				</p>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Elaine – Decreasing Compaction (Southern GA / Northern FL)</h2>
				<p>
					One of the main reasons I wanted to try MycorrPlus was our soil
					compaction issues. Paul assured me that compaction would gradually
					disappear after using MycorrPlus A. We tried it on our 1,000 acres of
					pasture and grass hay.
				</p>
				<p>
					After just 3 weeks, where we applied MycorrPlus, the soil probe would
					go down about 1" – but not at all in a control field. After 2 months,
					the probe went down 2.5" in the treated area, while the control field
					still resisted penetration. Right after a rain, I can drive the probe
					down 4". The compaction is getting better, and I believe this decrease
					is one reason for improved water infiltration, which in turn benefits
					the grass.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even my husband—a true "show-me" person—is now excited after seeing
					the difference within just over 2 months.
				</p>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Elaine – Cattle Fertility (Mid-February)</h2>
				<p>
					I believe the sea minerals in MycorrPlus will increase fertility. We
					have heifers and last year we had an unusual number of paternal twins.
					Our cows bred in a shorter period last year, with 110 out of 159 born
					in the first 30 days of calving. Over the winter, our calves remained
					fit without drawing down. Our cows are the best looking they've ever
					been in mid-February and are showing excellent re-breeding potential.
				</p>

			{/* Testimonial 4 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Elaine – Clover Revival (Mid-February)</h2>
				<p>
					Our soil compaction had worsened over the years, and our clover wasn't
					thriving. Today, February 1st, after using MycorrPlus in July, our
					clover was already 6" high. Last year by mid-March it was only 5"
					tall. Our clover is back! With ample clover and rye grass, our cows
					are eating hay less, and the treated pasture has filled in
					remarkably—even my husband is amazed.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 5 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Elaine – Grasshoppers and Fire Ants (Mid-March)</h2>
				<p>
					Last fall, I noticed fire ants along the cow paths. This spring, I saw
					calves digging at the mounds—and found no fire ants. I called an
					entomologist, and he explained that the fungi in MycorrPlus (which I
					confirmed it contained) can kill fire ants. I also observed a decrease
					in grasshoppers compared to last year. Several neighbors have since
					purchased MycorrPlus after seeing the results.
				</p>

			{/* Testimonial 6 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Oat Farmer – Oats (MO)</h2>
				<p>
					A friend used MycorrPlus A this year, applying it with a fan-type
					nozzle. In his oat field, everywhere the tractor passed, there was a
					ridge of oats that were taller and darker green. This seems to show
					that a slightly heavier application can give better results.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 7 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Leroy – Clover in Pasture (TX)</h2>
				<p>
					Leroy ordered another 5 buckets of MycorrPlus for this year. He said
					that the product worked so well last year that his clover is
					incredibly tall and healthy this spring—so much so that he almost
					hesitates to let the cows graze it.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Andrew Curtiss – Seed Potatoes & Vegetables (Shalom Vegetables, MI)
				</h2>
				<p>
					"My experience with MycorrPlus was excellent. I grow CSA and farm
					market vegetables on about 1 acre of land that had been used for
					conventional agriculture for 30 years. On recommendation, I applied an
					equivalent of 40 oz. in May 2015. I planted 75 pounds of seed potatoes
					and ended up with a 1,200-pound harvest. My shell peas produced large
					quantities for nearly 6 weeks, and my bush snap beans kept flowering
					even after we stopped picking. The flavor of our produce was
					exceptional, and at the farmers market I was complimented every week.
					The product's ability to help plants withstand stress—after nearly 5
					inches of rain in 2 days followed by 21 days without rain—was
					remarkable. When we tore the garden down, I was blown away by the
					extensive mycorrhizal fungi on the roots. God's creation is truly
					amazing! Thanks for an awesome product."

				<h2>Roger Berns – Corn & Cattle (WI)</h2>
				<p>
					On my open-pollinated corn, the TDN was 87.95, protein 10.56, and test
					weights 60.9. Some ears were notably filled out. My corn yields were
					up, and my grazing fields lasted longer. My cattle are fatter and in
					great shape, and my apples and cider have received excellent feedback.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 10 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Mark – Corn, Sunflowers & Pasture (NE)</h2>
				<p>
					In 2015, I applied 10 gallons per acre of fish, biologicals, and
					enzymes. In 2016, I only used MycorrPlus (16 oz. broadcast and 16 oz.
					in-the-row). Even in a particularly dry year, my organic blue corn
					yielded 20% more and my sunflowers 25% more than in 2015. My pasture
					also improved, with Canadian thistles turning yellow and being grazed
					down by buffalo. My dad commented, "This stuff sure does work!"
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 11 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Valentine – Corn, Soybeans & Hay (IN)</h2>
				<p>
					I noticed improvement in plant growth and yields—more hay with fewer
					cuttings. Corn and beans looked excellent, with a few four-bean pods
					in the bean field. Soil and root structures improved noticeably.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 12 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Wayne – Dairy (KY)</h2>
				<p>
					I applied MycorrPlus on my corn silage, and my cows are now licking it
					right up. My protein was down a point since I wasn't boosting with
					nitrogen, but my milk production per ton of feed increased. The main
					nutrients in the forage sample remained similar to last year.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 13 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Leonard – Pasture (FL)</h2>
				<p>
					Operating a family farm in North Central Florida since 1976, I applied
					MycorrPlus to 120 acres of newly planted Bahia grass. The grazing was
					remarkable—by summer the field was knee-deep in grass without
					additional fertilizer. An additional 80 acres of newly seeded grass
					also showed exceptional stand establishment, even in a dry spring. I
					intend to continue using MycorrPlus, as I've never seen grazing like
					this before.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 14 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>John – Pasture (TX)</h2>
				<p>
					I saw improved plant growth and yields with MycorrPlus. The treated
					area was more structured, had longer root systems, and contained white
					fungi strands. The soil retained moisture better, fire ants were
					absent, and fire mounds were dying.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 15 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Jane – Hay Fields (TN)</h2>
				<p>
					We applied 2 quarts per acre of MycorrPlus. The leaves are thicker,
					yields improved, and the soil is looser with larger root beds. There
					are more earthworms, less run-off, and better drought tolerance.
					Treated fields show better growth with less weed and insect pressure.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 16 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Harvey – Pasture (Delaware)</h2>
				<p>
					I applied 1 quart per acre and saw improved growth and yields. A metal
					rod easily penetrated 2 feet into the treated soil, which also had
					more earthworms and less weed and insect pressure.
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 17 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Ryan – Black Oats (GA)</h2>
				<p>
					"I will be honest, I thought MycorrPlus was snake oil when I first
					applied it. However, the results were impressive: better germination,
					growth of 50 grams compared to 14 grams, warmer soils, mushrooms
					throughout the field, deeper root systems, and overall warmer soil
					temperatures."
				</p>
			</section>

			{/* Testimonial 18 */}
			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Karen – Pasture Comparison (NE)</h2>
				<p>
					With a SARE grant, we compared treatments (MycorrPlus-A, Sea 90, fish
					emulsion/raw milk/molasses, and a control) on our rotationally grazed
					pasture. Over two years, soil tests and Solvita results showed
					improvements in organic matter, CO2 respiration, total nitrogen and
					carbon, and overall soil health. In side-by-side comparisons, the
					MycorrPlus area had the deepest root penetration and showed excellent
					improvement in convenience and ease of use.
