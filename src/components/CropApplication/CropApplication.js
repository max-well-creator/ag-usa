			<h1>Mycorr Plusâ„¢ Crop Application Guidelines</h1>
			<p>
				When used correctly, MycorrPlus (formerly called GroPal Balance) can
				make a real difference in what you grow. Here are some application
				guidelines for various crops.
			</p>

			<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
			<p>
				Broadcast in a 20 gal./acre tank mix, or 40+ gal./acre if no rain is
				expected for a few days. A 10 gal./acre tank mix (or 3 gal. with a
				plane) may be used if within 24 hours rain or irrigation water carries
				it in, or if it is worked into the ground. MycorrPlus needs at least an
				inch of soil moisture before it will really take off in the soil.
			</p>
			<p>Organic growers: MycorrPlus-O may be used in place of MycorrPlus-A.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Herbicide or other chemical apps.</strong> <br />
				If an herbicide or other chemical application is needed, wait 3 or more
				days after the application and then apply 16 to 32 ounces of
				MycorrPlus-A per acre.
			</p>
			<p>
				If regular chemical applications are being made, to restore balance to
				the soil, once a month you may apply 32 ounces per acre of MycorrPlus-A.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Do NOT</strong> apply MycorrPlus in the same tank mix as
				herbicides, fungicides or insecticides.
			</p>

			<h2>Crop-Specific Guidelines</h2>

			<h3>Pasture</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus does a great job on pastures. Apply MycorrPlus-A or O once a
				year, any time of year.
			</p>
			<p>
				The standard application for pastures is 1 quart per acre. For quicker
				results, apply 64 ounces per acre.
			</p>

			<h3>Grass Hay</h3>
			<p>
				Apply 1 to 2 quarts per acre of MycorrPlus-A or O. If nitrogen is needed
				the first year, it is best to use 28% or 32% nitrogen, or manure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along with a yearly soil application, for even better results apply 2
				quarts per acre of MycorrPlus-F (or MycorrPlus-O-F for organic) as a
				foliar application 7 to 10 days after cuttings.
			</p>

			<h3>Alfalfa</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus is wonderful for strengthening the root structure and
				thickening up alfalfa. Apply 1 to 2 quarts per acre of MycorrPlus-A or
				O. A great time to apply is in the fall, winter or spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>(Optional foliar application)</em> 10 to 15 days after each cutting,
				when there is sufficient leaf for a foliar application, apply 2 quarts
				per acre of MycorrPlus-F or O-F as a top-dress/foliar application.
			</p>

			<h3>Soybeans</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus promotes a huge root structure, which can result in more pods
				and fuller pods. MycorrPlus is a world-class inoculant that can produce
				excellent nodulation; no other inoculant should be needed besides
				MycorrPlus. However, other inoculants may be mixed in if desired.
			</p>
			<p>
				At planting, apply 1 quart of MycorrPlus-A or O either in the row, on
				the seed, or banded over the row. If not set up for in-row or
				over-the-row applications, broadcast 2 quarts per acre around planting
				time.
			</p>
			<p>
				For increased yields, apply 2 quarts per acre as a MycorrPlus-F foliar
				application (or 3 quarts O-F for organic) at flower. A second foliar
				application 3 to 4 weeks later may be beneficial if the beans are
				looking good.
			</p>
			<p>
				Foliar applications may be mixed with herbicides.{" "}

			</p>

			<h3>Corn</h3>
			<p>
				Apply 1 quart of MycorrPlus-A in the row, on the seed. Another quart may
				be side-dressed with 28% or 32% to stabilize it, then reduce your total
				nitrogen to 80 or 90 pounds for 200-bushel corn. You may mix a quart of
				MycorrPlus-A with other applications of 28% or 32% nitrogen to help bind
				it to the soil, allowing you to reduce the nitrogen applied by 30%.
				<strong>Do NOT mix with phosphorus or potassium.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Five to six weeks after planting, another quart of MycorrPlus-A may be
				applied to boost yields.
			</p>
			<p>
				If using anhydrous ammonia, broadcast a quart of MycorrPlus-A at least 2
				weeks after its application to help reduce the negative effects on the
				soil.
			</p>
			<p>
				A top-dress/foliar application of 2 quarts of MycorrPlus-F or O-F may be
				applied at tassel using a 10 gal./acre tank mix. This can help increase
				test weights, protein, RFV and yields. Alternatively, a quick pass of
				the sprinkler over the field using 3 quarts of MycorrPlus-O-F may be
				used.

			</p>

			<h3>Wheat, Milo and Millet</h3>
			<p>
				For winter wheat, spring wheat, milo and millet, broadcast 1 to 2 quarts
				of MycorrPlus-A or O around planting time. Use just 1 quart per acre
				when applying with a drill or in the row. For winter wheat, if applying
				in the spring, apply early spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				To boost yields, a top-dress/foliar application of 2 quarts of
				MycorrPlus-F (or 3 quarts of MycorrPlus-O-F for organic) may be made at
				flag leaf.
			</p>

			<h3>Cotton</h3>
			<p>
				Apply 1 quart of MycorrPlus-A or O in-the-row, on-the-seed (in furrow)
				or broadcast 1 to 2 quarts.{" "}
				<strong>
					Do NOT mix MycorrPlus-A with any chemical except 28% or 32% nitrogen.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				For pre-planting, for even better results, apply 1 to 2 quarts of
				MycorrPlus-A or O in the summer, fall or winter before planting. This
				helps eliminate harmful nematodes, salts, fungus, mold, mildew, rot and
				plant toxins so that the soil is ready at planting time.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the growing season for increased yields, apply 1 quart of
				MycorrPlus-A 5 to 6 weeks after planting to give more energy for
				fruiting, or a 2-quart per acre top-dress/foliar application of
				MycorrPlus-F (3 quarts O-F for organic) as the plant begins to set
				bolls.
			</p>
			<p>MycorrPlus-F may be mixed with an herbicide if needed.</p>

			<h3>Peanuts</h3>
			<p>
				Apply 1 quart of MycorrPlus-A or O in-the-row, on-the-seed (in furrow)
				or broadcast 2 quarts.
			</p>
			<p>
				For pre-planting, apply 1 to 2 quarts of MycorrPlus-A or O in the
				summer, fall or winter to prepare the soil.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Do NOT mix MycorrPlus-A with any chemical except 28% or 32% nitrogen.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				For increased yields, a foliar application of 2 quarts of MycorrPlus-F
				may be made every 4 weeks during the growing season.
			</p>
			<p>
				If chemical applications are being made, apply 1 quart of MycorrPlus-A
				each month in place of MycorrPlus-F.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although MycorrPlus may be mixed with an inoculant, it is a world-class
				inoculant that produces excellent nodulation, so it should be the only
				inoculant needed.
			</p>

			<h3>Potatoes</h3>
			<p>
				In the fall, winter or early spring, apply 2 quarts of MycorrPlus-A to
				help prepare the soil for a good crop.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apply 1 quart in-the-row, or broadcast 1 to 2 quarts around planting,
				and/or after an herbicide application.
			</p>

			<h3>Fruit and Nut Trees</h3>
			<p>
				In the fall, broadcast 1 to 2 quarts per acre of MycorrPlus-A over an
				area twice the diameter of the tree for great results the following
				year. For best results, apply as early as possible when the ground is
				not frozen.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the spring, once the tree has good leaf coverage, apply one or more
				foliar applications of MycorrPlus-F. Use 2 quarts per acre with a 20
				gal./acre tank mix. For tank mixes over 20 gal./acre, use
				MycorrPlus-O-F. When planning 4 or more foliar applications, divide up
				to 2 gallons of MycorrPlus-F by the number of applications.
			</p>

			<h3>Grape Vines</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus can help maintain neutral soil pH for grape vines. Apply 2
				quarts of MycorrPlus-A per acre (or 1 ounce for every 600 sq. ft.). This
				can be done in the fall or early spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the spring, once the vines have sufficient leaf coverage, one or more
				foliar applications of MycorrPlus-F may be made. Apply 2 quarts per acre
				per application. If planning 4 or more foliar applications, divide up to
				2 gallons of MycorrPlus-F by the number of desired applications.
			</p>

			<h3>Sod Farms</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus-A works well to increase root structure and thicken up grass.
				Once the sod has been harvested, apply 2 quarts of MycorrPlus-A to the
				soil.
			</p>
			<p>
				If desired, apply an additional 32 ounces of MycorrPlus-A each month. Do
				not mix with herbicides, pesticides, or most fertilizers.
			</p>

			<h3>Blueberries and Other Acid-Loving Plants</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus helps to balance pH; however, at this time we are not
				recommending its use for acid-loving plants.

				GroPal Balance will probably be the only fertilizer you will need for
				great pasture. Some may choose to further boost the process by adding a
				natural product like fish or kelp. However, though these are great
				products, you will probably find yourself producing amazing pastures
				without them!
