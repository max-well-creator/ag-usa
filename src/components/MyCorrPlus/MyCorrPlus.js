			<h1>Mycorr Plus™</h1>
			<p>
				Would you like to build dark, rich topsoil? AG-USA's MycorrPlus-A and
				MycorrPlus-O prompt an incredible amount of carbon sequestration by the
				plant into the soil. Carbon sequestration is the absolute fastest and
				best way to create new topsoil. Learn why secreting sugars (carbon)
				through the roots into the soil can create topsoil up to 10 times faster
				than can be done through the use of compost or other organic matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus-A and O help to provide the perfect growing environment for
				plants—a growing environment that contains all the nutrients the plant
				needs for optimum productivity and nutrient density.
			</p>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus-A and O are a combination of two products—Soil Balance and
				GroPal (also marketed as Ocean Trace).
			</p>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Soil Balance</h2>
				<p>
					Soil Balance is a combination of numerous ingredients, including humic
					and fulvic acids. Its job is to help balance nutrients AND energies in
					the soil.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>GroPal</h2>
				<p>
					GroPal is a sea mineral concentrate. One hundred gallons of Australian
					ocean water are evaporated down to a 1-gallon concentrate, making it a
					product packed with trace minerals. GroPal supplies macro and trace
					minerals that have been proven beneficial to plants.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>How MycorrPlus-A and O Work</h2>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus-A and O form something like an aerobic membrane that holds
					and balances nutrients to help bring balance to the soil. This aerobic
					membrane expands—almost like a sack—that holds carbon and other
					nutrients, making them available to the plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					They offer the soil ingredients necessary to re-establish the natural
					and productive relationship between soil and plants. The products
					include several genera of aerobic bacteria, fungi, and soil organisms,
					with molasses added as an energy source for the microorganisms. These
					native micro-organisms help to make both macro and micro nutrients
					available to plants.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the microorganisms begin digesting chemicals and salts and removing
					harmful elements (including anaerobic bacteria, which cause most plant
					diseases), the anaerobic soil is converted to aerobic soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					The multiplication of microorganisms and the fixation of sugars
					provided by plants flocculates the soil, separating soil particles and
					creating air spaces essential for proper water and air balance in the
					soil. Without these spaces, the soil may become oversaturated or too
					dry, both of which slow root growth and restrict above-ground plant
					growth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, MycorrPlus-A and O enable the soil to become the ideal
					environment for plant life by changing soil pH to a near neutral level
					(making sulfur available to plants) without the use of lime.
				</p>

				<h2>The Nutrient Package and Energy Balance</h2>
				<p>
					Once the nutrients are balanced (both macro and micro), the energy in
					the soil increases—resulting in increased plant growth. The results
					are due not only to the nutrient release directly but from the
					comprehensive nutrient package provided by MycorrPlus. The more
					balanced the soil, the higher its energy.

				<h2>Give MycorrPlus a Try!</h2>
				<p>
					Many farmers want to see results on a small scale before committing to
					a large-scale application. Try it in one area and avoid applying any
					other products in that test area.

				<h2>Customer Testimonial</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Pastor Andrew Curtiss, Shalom Vegetables in Michigan:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					"My experience with the GroPal Balance (MycorrPlus-A) was excellent. I
					grow CSA and farm market vegetables on about 1 acre of land that had
					been used for conventional agriculture for 30 years prior to 2015. On
					your recommendation, I applied an equivalent of 40 oz. of GroPal
					Balance A in May 2015. To say I was impressed is an understatement. I
					planted 75 pounds of seed potatoes and ended up with a 1,200-pound
					harvest. My shell peas produced large quantities of sweet peas for
					nearly 6 weeks, and our bush snap beans kept flowering even after we
					stopped picking them. The flavor of our produce was exceptional, and I
					received weekly compliments at the farmers market. The product's
					ability to help plants withstand stress—such as five inches of rain in
					two days followed by 21 days without rain—was truly remarkable. When
					it was time to tear the garden down, I was amazed by the mycorrhizal
					fungi all over the roots. I firmly believe that the symbiotic
					relationship between the plants and their roots was the key to our
					success in 2015. God's creation is truly amazing! Thanks for an
					awesome product."
				</p>
				<p>
					Some may choose to further boost the process by adding a natural
					product like fish or kelp; however, you will likely achieve great
					results without them!
