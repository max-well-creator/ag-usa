			<h1>How to Transform Grass into Superfood</h1>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>No Sickness in the Ocean</h2>
				<p>
					Why did Dr. Maynard Murray find absolutely no sickness in the ocean?
					He biopsied numerous sea creatures in the middle of the ocean and
					discovered that they had none of the diseases found in fish from lakes
					and rivers. In fact, Dr. Murray found zero sickness or disease in
					ocean animals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many years of research led Dr. Murray to conclude that there is no
					sickness in the ocean because ocean plants live in a perfect mineral
					environment.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Land Plants Transformed with Sea Minerals</h2>
				<p>
					When Dr. Murray fertilized fields with sea minerals, the plants
					growing there became highly immune to disease. Laboratory tests showed
					that animals fed with those plants became highly immune as well.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Grass, the Perfect Land Plant</h2>
				<p>
					Researchers using sea minerals to fertilize plants have found that
					grass is the only plant that utilizes all 76 minerals found in the
					ocean. (Tomatoes utilize only 45, and corn even less.) When grass is
					fertilized with sea minerals, tests reveal the presence of all 76
					minerals.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Transforming Your Crops to Superfood</h2>
				<p>
					Is there an economical way to get sea minerals onto your land?
					Transportation of ocean water is expensive and sea solids are high in
					sodium. Introducing <strong>GroPal</strong> – an organic sea mineral
					concentrate in which nearly 99% of the sodium has been removed during
					evaporation, leaving a dense, low-sodium solution.
				</p>

				<h2>But It Gets Even Better</h2>
				<h3>Transforming the Soil</h3>
				<p>
					There is a product called Soil Balance that forms an aerobic membrane
					in the soil, holding and balancing nutrients. This membrane expands
					like a sack that holds carbon and other essential nutrients, making
					them available to the plant.
				</p>
				<h3>And Soil Balance Does So Much More</h3>
				<p>
					Soil Balance prompts an incredible amount of carbon sequestration by
					the plant into the soil. Carbon sequestration is the fastest and best
					way to create new topsoil – up to 10 times faster than compost or
					other organic matter. It provides the perfect growing environment,
					ensuring that plants have all the nutrients needed for optimum
					productivity and nutrient density.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Bringing Two Great Products Together</h2>
				<p>
					We have combined GroPal and Soil Balance to create one powerful
					product for farms—MycorrPlus (formerly called GroPal Balance).
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Grass Becomes Superfood</h2>
				<p>
					Thanks to the strength of these two products, when just 32 to 64
					ounces of this highly concentrated formula is applied per acre, crops
					turn into superfood! Since "we are what we eat," the effects on
					livestock are remarkable. One farmer shared that after spraying his
					field, his veterinarian remarked how his cows had transformed from
					some of the poorest-looking to some of the best-looking cattle in the
					area.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>How MycorrPlus Works</h2>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus prompts the plant to sequester huge amounts of sugars
					(carbon) into the soil. These sugars feed and groom beneficial
					bacteria, which then convert locked-up nutrients into available plant
					food.

				<h2>Why MycorrPlus Out-Performs Other Soil Building Tools</h2>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus is incredibly successful at building soil. It facilitates
					rapid topsoil formation by stimulating beneficial aerobic bacteria and
					mycorrhizal fungi while providing essential nutrients—including a rich
					supply of ocean trace minerals.
				</p>
				<p>
					When plants secrete sugars into the soil, those sugars act as glue to
					bind soil particles together, forming complex soil structure that
					includes stable carbon and humus. As a result, new topsoil forms in
					just weeks under optimal conditions.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Benefits of Sequestering Carbon into the Soil</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Enhanced soil structure and water retention</li>
					<li>Improved nutrient availability through increased CEC</li>
					<li>Up to a 25-30% increase in yields the first year</li>
					<li>Faster overall plant growth and productivity</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "30px" }}>
				<h2>Why Chemical Fertilizers Slow Soil Building</h2>
				<p>
					If plants obtain phosphorus and potash too easily from chemical
					fertilizers, they reduce the secretion of sugars into the soil. This
					interruption in carbon flow diminishes soil aggregation and topsoil
					formation. In biologically active soils, even synthetic nitrogen can
					be counterproductive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Soil tests only reveal what is available by passive uptake; the vast
					majority of minerals, made available by microbes, remain unseen. By
					nurturing aerobic microbes, we unlock these hidden nutrients.
