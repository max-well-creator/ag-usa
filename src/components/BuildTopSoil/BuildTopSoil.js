			<h1>The Fastest Method for Building Wonderful Topsoil</h1>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Why Other Methods Fall Short</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Compost and added organic matter give short-term results but fade in
						a few years.
					</li>
					<li>
						Weathering of rock releases nutrients, but it doesn’t build lasting
						topsoil.
					</li>
					<li>
						Natural fertilizers like fish and kelp are expensive and less
						effective.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Carbon Sequestration: Nature’s Fast Lane</h2>
				<p>
					The fastest and best way to build topsoil is through carbon
					sequestration by plant roots. Plants use photosynthesis to create
					sugars, obtaining 85–90% of the building blocks from the air. These
					sugars are exuded by roots, acting as a glue to form stable,
					structured soil rich in carbon and humus.
				</p>
				<p>
					This process produces topsoil that quickly absorbs and holds water—a
					perfect defense against drought.

				<h2>How MycorrPlus Accelerates Soil Building</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Stimulates Microbes:</strong> It triggers beneficial aerobic
						bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi to flourish.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Supplies Essential Nutrients:</strong> Provides a balanced
						blend of nutrients, including ocean trace minerals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Boosts Sugar Secretion:</strong> Energizes plants to secrete
						more sugars into the soil, rapidly forming topsoil.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Activation:</strong> Works best with at least 1.1" of
						moisture and soil temperatures above 45°F.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Benefits of Rapid Carbon Sequestration</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Improved soil structure and water retention</li>
					<li>
						Enhanced nutrient availability and increased cation-exchange
						capacity
					</li>
					<li>
						Faster plant growth with up to a 25–30% yield increase in the first
						year
					</li>
					<li>Cost-effective soil building using only 32–64 ounces per acre</li>
				</ul>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Why Chemical Fertilizers Are Less Effective</h2>
				<p>
					When plants receive easily available NPK, they reduce sugar
					secretion—hindering the microbial processes that build soil. Standard
					soil tests miss the 97% of minerals released by microbes, which are
					essential for long-term soil health.
