			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: Do I need to apply MycorrPlus each year?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: It is beneficial to put out at least 32 ounces of MycorrPlus-A
					(formerly called GroPal Balance) each year to help transform the soil.
					A 64 ounce application helps to accelerate the process.
				</p>
			</div>

				<p>
					<strong>
						Q: Do I need to apply MycorrPlus after every cutting of hay?
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: That is up to you. If you want to really boost yields, an
					additional 32 ounces of MycorrPlus-A may be applied immediately after
					each cutting. Another option is to apply two quarts of MycorrPlus-F
					foliar. Wait long enough after the cutting to have enough leaf to
					receive the application, usually 7 to 14 days.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: I have almost no top soil. Will MycorrPlus help?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: Even the poorest soils contain good amounts of calcium, phosphorus
					and potassium, though they may not be available to the plant. Apply 1
					to 2 quarts of MycorrPlus-A or O per acre to help initiate soil
					building. The bacterial action is what is needed to highly structure
					the soil and initiate soil building.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>
						Q: Which forms of nitrogen are the most compatible with MycorrPlus?
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: 28% and 32% are the two forms of nitrogen that may be mixed with
					MycorrPlus. Pour your MycorrPlus into the tank first, add any water
					that is needed, then add in the nitrogen.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: Can I afford MycorrPlus?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>A: Good news! We have an application for every budget.</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: Which microbes does MycorrPlus have?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: MycorrPlus has 4 strains of mycorrhizal fungi and more than 70
					aerobic bacillus strains. However, MycorrPlus isn't a biological; it
					is a bio-stimulant. It is a wonderful food source that gets our great
					biological package established in the soil.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: My ground is dry. Can I still apply MycorrPlus?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: When the ground is dry, it is best to try to apply MycorrPlus just
					before a rain. Use at least a 20 gal./acre tank mix to supply enough
					water to carry MycorrPlus down out of direct sunlight. If it might be
					a week or more before a rain, it is best to apply a 40+ gallon tank
					mix per acre. Another option is to disk in your MycorrPlus. Disking 1
					to 2 inches deep is optimal.
				</p>
			</div>

				<p>
					<strong>
						Q: My containers of MycorrPlus seem to be bloating. What should I
						do?
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: MycorrPlus is alive with beneficial bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi.
					Because of this, and especially in warmer storage conditions, it is
					best to loosen the lid and allow gas to vent. Failure to do so might
					result in pressurization.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: How quickly will MycorrPlus begin working?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: MycorrPlus needs two things to activate it. It needs 1.1" or more
					of moisture and as little as 1/20th of an inch of rain to carry it
					down into the soil. The moisture gives the bacteria what they need to
					proliferate. MycorrPlus also needs a soil temperature of 40 to 45°F
					for proper activation. Once activated, it goes to work immediately to
					improve soil tilth and increase the soil's ability to hold moisture.
					Within as little as a month you might notice that rain soaks in
					better, and within a few months the results can be quite remarkable.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: When is the best time to apply MycorrPlus?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: Spring, summer, fall or winter (as long as the soil is permeable).
					Get it on as soon as possible so that it can get started in
					transforming your soil. Our Application Guideline sheet will tell you
					more.
				</p>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>
						Q: Once I apply a herbicide, pesticide, fungicide or insecticide,
						how long should I wait before I can make an application of
						MycorrPlus?
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: Three days, unless it has rained after the chemical application, in
					which case it is best to wait at least 2 days.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: How is it best used with anhydrous ammonia?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: Anhydrous ammonia is especially hard on the soil. Wait 2 or more
					weeks after putting on anhydrous before putting on 1 to 2 quarts of
					MycorrPlus.
				</p>

					<strong>
						Q: There are rock-like crystals in the bottom of the jug. What
						should I do?
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: It is not unusual to find crystals in the bottom of the jug.
					MycorrPlus is a super concentrated liquid, and over time or if it is
					exposed to cold temperatures, some minerals (mostly magnesium chloride
					and potassium chloride) will fall out of solution and solidify as
					crystals. If this happens, you can usually just dump them right in the
					spray tank and they will re-dissolve back into solution. Another
					option is to just throw them out on the field, yard or garden.
				</p>

			<div className="faq-item" style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
				<p>
					<strong>Q: What if MycorrPlus doesn't work?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A: If MycorrPlus doesn't seem to work, please use the following to
					troubleshoot the problem:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Application:</strong> Did the person assigned to apply/use
						the product do so? We had one instance where the owner assigned an
						employee the job of applying our product. The owner complained our
						product didn’t work! We found the product still sitting in the
						storage shed—it had not been applied.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Correct Application:</strong> Did they apply the product
						correctly? If our application guidelines are followed, it almost
						ensures that MycorrPlus will work.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Tank Mix Issues:</strong> Were any other products added
						after applying MycorrPlus? Our instructions state that most other
						products should not be added in the same tank mix with MycorrPlus,
						as they will reduce its effectiveness. If approved products are
						being mixed, be sure to follow the proper procedure.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Time to Work:</strong> Have you given MycorrPlus adequate
						time to work? It transforms the soil, which takes time before
						results become evident. A farmer in Oregon, for example, saw his
						organic matter increase from 0.4% to 4.7% over 8 years. Give
						MycorrPlus some time, and you will LOVE the results!
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Storage Conditions:</strong> Was MycorrPlus properly stored?
						It should not be stored in direct sunlight or in temperatures above
						100°F or below 0°F. Freezing temperatures won’t hurt the bacteria,
						but they might cause minerals to fall out of solution.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Previous Products:</strong> What products have you used for
						weed and/or insect control previously? Sometimes a heavy carry-over
						from previous chemicals may require an extra application of
						MycorrPlus.
					</li>
				</ul>
