		<div className={styles.container}>
			<p>
				Loosen the lid immediately to vent MycorrPlus and prevent pressure
				build‑up.
			</p>
			<p>Store in a cool, shaded area below 120°F (ideally under 100°F).</p>

			<h2>Application Instructions</h2>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus‑A and MycorrPlus‑O (organic) are designed for soil
				improvement—not for foliar use until you’ve used 64 oz of the product.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apply MycorrPlus alone or mix with fish, kelp, or liquid nitrogen (28%
				or 32%). Always add MycorrPlus first, then water, and finally the other
				additives. (Always perform a jar test.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The product can be applied in spring, summer, fall, or winter. Early
				spring helps boost that year's crop, while fall or winter applications
				transform the soil for the next season.
			</p>

			<h3>Safe Application Rate</h3>
			<p>
				Over‑application is rarely harmful—but using more than 1 gal/acre may
				burn plant leaves.
			</p>

			<h3>Overcoming Application Challenges</h3>
			<h4>1. Sun Protection</h4>
			<p>To shield microbes from UV rays:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If plowing/discing no deeper than 6", apply MycorrPlus immediately
					before the final soil work or use chiseling.
				</li>
				<li>If cultivating, apply before cultivation.</li>
				<li>For in‑row or seed applications, use your regular tank mix.</li>
				<li>For side-dressing, mix 2 qt/acre with your nitrogen.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>2. Moving Product Off the Leaf</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If no rain is forecast, use a 40+ gal/acre tank mix; if rain is
					expected soon, 20 gal/acre is sufficient; if watered in immediately,
					3–10 gal/acre works.
				</li>
				<li>
					Can be applied with irrigation or drip lines (ensure any fungus is
					screened off first).
				</li>
				<li>Mix with manure or lagoon water, then spread accordingly.</li>
				<li>
					For lagoon water, apply 5 gal per 250,000 gal; for composting manure,
					use 12 oz per cubic yard.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>3. Protecting Microbes from Dry Ground</h4>
			<p>
				Keeping the soil covered protects microbes from direct sunlight and
				prevents moisture loss. Crop residue, trampled forage, and cover crops
				help maintain soil cover and organic matter.
			</p>

			<h3>Phosphorus, Potassium, and MycorrPlus</h3>
			<p>
				Most soils have abundant but unavailable phosphorus and potassium.
				MycorrPlus’s microbes mobilize these nutrients, saving you fertilizer
				costs. Mycorrhizal fungi can even transport phosphorus from deeper soil
				layers to the roots.
			</p>

			<h3>Nitrogen Applications</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus contains nitrogen‑fixing bacteria that need 4–5 months to
				kick in. For nitrogen‑demanding crops like corn, you might still need to
				apply some N, but you can often reduce your rate by 30% or more when
				using MycorrPlus.
			</p>
			<p>
				For anhydrous ammonia, apply 1 qt of MycorrPlus‑A two weeks after
				ammonia application.
			</p>

			<h3>Herbicides and MycorrPlus</h3>
			<p>
				Herbicides damage soil life. Wait a few days after herbicide
				application—2 to 3 weeks for pre‑emergents—to allow the herbicide to
				work before applying MycorrPlus. For knock‑down herbicides, wait at
				least 3 days.
			</p>

			<h3>Timing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>For first‑time application, use MycorrPlus as soon as possible.</li>
				<li>If sowing seed in under a month, wait until after planting.</li>
				<li>If tilling (6" or less), apply just before the final soil work.</li>
				<li>
					After an herbicide application, wait at least 3 days (or 2–3 weeks for
					residual herbicides) before applying MycorrPlus.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Foliar Application Guidelines</h3>
			<p>For foliar (top‑dress) applications:</p>
			<p>
				- MycorrPlus-F: 2 qt/acre is $18/acre; MycorrPlus-O-F: 3 qt/acre is
				$23.10/acre (bucket pricing).
			</p>
			<p>
				Apply in the morning or evening (below 80–85°F) when stomata are open,
				using a 10 gal/acre tank mix or 3+ gal/acre via plane.
			</p>

			<h3>Small Area Applications</h3>
			<p>For areas smaller than an acre:</p>
			<p>
				- 1 tsp per 100 sq. ft. in a gallon or more of water, or 1 tsp per quart
				for pump sprayers.
