			<p>
				To prevent the build-up of pressure, please loosen the lid of MycorrPlus
				right away to allow it to vent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Do not store in direct sunlight. Store below 120&deg;F, and preferably
				below 100&deg;F.
			</p>

			<h2>Application Instructions</h2>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus-A and MycorrPlus-O (for organic use) are for the soil, not
				the leaf. Their strength lies in their ability to transform the soil.
				For best results, don't consider MycorrPlus foliar until you have
				utilized a full 64 ounces of MycorrPlus-A or MycorrPlus-O.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apply MycorrPlus by itself, or with fish, kelp, 28% or 32%. Add
				MycorrPlus to tank first. Add water before adding fish or kelp. Always
				jar test.
			</p>
			<p>MycorrPlus A or O may be applied spring, summer, fall or winter.</p>
			<p>
				An early or late spring application can help improve that year's crop.
				Apply ASAP to get it.
			</p>
			<p>
				A summer application can raise nutrients in the plant, but results might
				not be seen until the fall or spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				A fall application will allow MycorrPlus to improve the soil throughout
				the fall and early spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				A winter application works well as long as moisture is able to soak into
				the ground. A strength of a winter application is that most all of the
				ultraviolet rays of the sun are blocked by the atmosphere.
			</p>

			<h3>The amount of MycorrPlus that can safely be applied</h3>
			<p>
				It is almost impossible to hurt the soil by over-applying MycorrPlus.
				However, applying more than a gallon/acre in one application might burn
				the leaves of the plant.
			</p>

			<h3>Overcoming Application Difficulties</h3>

			<h4>1. Ultra-violet rays of the sun</h4>
			<p>
				Although MycorrPlus-A and O contain zinc that acts like a sunscreen to
				protect its microbes from the sun, precautions should still be put into
				place. Here are ways to protect our microbes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you will be plowing no deeper than 6 inches or discing the soil,
					apply MycorrPlus-A or O, then work it in just before the final time
					you work the soil. You may also chisel it to help it interact with the
					soil.
				</li>
				<li>If cultivating, apply MycorrPlus, then cultivate.</li>
				<li>
					Applying in-the-row, on-the-seed/in furrow will hide MycorrPlus from
					the sun â€“ use the tank mix you normally use for in furrow
					applications.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are only set up to side dress, you can add 2 qt./acre
					MycorrPlus-A in with your 28% or 32%.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>2. Getting it off the leaf, down to the soil</h4>
			<p>
				Although MycorrPlus contains zinc that acts like a sunscreen to protect
				its microbes from the sun, precautions should still be put into place.
				Here are ways to protect our microbes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If no rain is predicted within a week, use a 40 or more gallon/acre
					tank mix to get it out of the sun and down to the soil. If watered in
					within a few days, you can use 20 gallons/acre. If watered in right
					away, a 3 gallon per acre with the plane or 10 gallon per acre with
					the spray rig will do.
				</li>
				<li>
					May be applied with irrigation. Can be put through a drip line if any
					fungus is screened off first.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add to manure or lagoon water and allow it to work then spread manure
					or apply lagoon water.
				</li>
				<li>
					To treat lagoon water, apply at the rate of 5 gallons for every
					250,000 gallons. To compost manure, use 12 oz. for every cubic yard.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>3. Bare ground dries out the soil, exposes microbes to the sun</h4>
			<p>
				It really helps to keep the soil covered. For exposed soil, the sun
				dries out the soil, plus it kills microbes that are closer to the
				surface.
			</p>
			<p>
				Crop litter and trampled forage work well to help protect the soil from
				the sun.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cover crops not only shelter the soil, but with MycorrPlus, they
				sequester sugars, building organic matter in the soil.
			</p>

			<h3>Phosphorus, Potassium and MycorrPlus</h3>
			<p>
				The average acre of farmland has 4,500 lbs. of tied up phosphorus, plus
				a major component of clay is potassium. The microbes in MycorrPlus help
				to make these available to the plant, which can save farmers a LOT on
				fertilizer. Potash may be needed for some vegetables, or for other crops
				where potassium levels are low in the region.
			</p>
			<p>
				In most cases, when MycorrPlus is active in the soil, no additional
				phosphorus should be needed, even for corn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Normally phosphorus is not mobile in the soil, but mycorrhizal fungi in
				MycorrPlus are able to transport phosphorus from deep in the soil back
				to the roots. Soil tests are normally only done for the top layer of the
				soil, but for most soils, mycorrhizae are bringing nutrients from far
				deeper than 6 inches. Therefore, a tissue analysis is the best way to
				verify that the plant has plenty of phosphorus, potassium and other
				nutrients.
			</p>

			<h3>Nitrogen Applications</h3>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus contains nitrogen fixing bacteria, but it takes 4 to 5 months
				for them to really start working. If you normally apply nitrogen, some N
				may be needed until the nitrogen fixing bacteria have a chance to really
				kick in.
			</p>
			<p>
				For corn and other crops that require a lot of N, you may need some
				nitrogen each year. MycorrPlus helps to hold nitrogen and keep it from
				wicking off, leaching out or getting tied up.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a fall, winter or early spring application of MycorrPlus has been
				put out, or when it is mixed in with 28% or 32%, most farmers can cut
				back on nitrogen 30% the first year, and more the second year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anhydrous ammonia is very hard on the soil. To help overcome this, apply
				a quart of MycorrPlus-A two weeks or more after applying anhydrous
				ammonia.
			</p>

			<h3>Herbicides and MycorrPlus</h3>
			<p>
				Herbicides damage soil life and soil balance. However, you can easily
				overcome this damage and still get great results. Just apply 16 to 32
				oz./acre of MycorrPlus-A a few days or more after a herbicide
				application to break down the herbicide and help restore balance to the
				soil.
			</p>
			<p>
				For pre-emergent herbicides, apply MycorrPlus-A 2 to 3 weeks after the
				application to give the herbicide more time to work before MycorrPlus
				breaks it down.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why wait 2 to 3 weeks? MycorrPlus will quickly break down the herbicide,
				so we want to give the herbicide the time it needs to work. For
				knock-down herbicide applications (including glyphosates), apply the
				herbicide, then wait 3 or more days and apply a 16 to 32 oz. application
				of MycorrPlus-A to help restore soil balance.
			</p>

			<h3>Timing of Applications</h3>
			<p>
				Most of the time, when putting out the first ever application of
				MycorrPlus, it is best to apply it as soon as possible so that it can
				start its work of transforming the soil. Here are a couple of
				exceptions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you will be sowing seed in less than a month, it is probably best
					to wait and apply over the seed. MycorrPlus is a great germinator, so
					we want to take advantage of this strength.
				</li>
				<li>
					If in a month or less you will be tilling (6 inches or less) or
					discing the soil, you may want to wait and apply it right before
					working the soil. Always apply just before the last time you work the
					soil before planting.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you will be applying an herbicide within a few weeks, you might
					want to wait until 3 days or more after that application to help break
					down the herbicide. For residuals, allow 2 or 3 weeks after
					application to give the herbicide time to work before applying
					MycorrPlus.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>MycorrPlus Foliar Application Rate Guidelines</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>MycorrPlus-F and O-F Foliar / Top Dress Fertilizer</strong>{" "}
				<br />
				Two quarts/acre of F is $18/acre, 3 quarts/acre of OF is $23.10/acre at
				the bucket size.
			</p>
			<p>
				One or more applications of MycorrPlus foliar may help increase yields,
				plus help to increase protein, test weights and relative feed value. Try
				to apply MycorrPlus foliar mornings or evenings when the temperature is
				below 80 to 85&deg; so that plant stomata are open.
			</p>
			<p>
				These foliar applications may be helpful for hay, row crops, fruits,
				vegetables or fruit or nut trees. MycorrPlus-F (not MycorrPlus-A) may be
				applied with herbicides, but consider cutting herbicides back 15%.
			</p>
			<p>Use a 10 gal./acre tank mix, or use 3+ gal./acre with a plane.</p>
			<p>
				MycorrPlus-O-F may be put on with the sprinkler by running it fast
				enough to keep most of the water on the leaf. MycorrPlus-F has a
				surfactant that is simply thinned down too much to use with the
				sprinkler.
			</p>
			<p>MycorrPlus is best applied at the following 3 times:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Two to four weeks post-emergence</li>
				<li>At flowering</li>
				<li>Most effectively, when the plant begins to fruit</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>MycorrPlus A or O Applications for Areas Smaller than an Acre</h3>
			<p>
				One teaspoon of MycorrPlus is perfect for 100 square feet in a gallon or
				more of water. An ounce treats 600 square feet.
			</p>
			<p>
				May be applied with a watering can or a hose-end sprayer. For a pump-up
				sprayer, add 1 tsp. per quart of water.
