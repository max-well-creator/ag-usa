					Last fall I sent out a letter to our customers who bought MycorrPlus
					(formerly called GroPal Balance), asking them to share their results.
					We heard back from quite a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most have confirmed that their plants have a larger root structure.
					Most can easily see that the soil is looser and more highly
					structured.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this article I would like to share with you what a number of our
					customers shared with us.

				<h2>PHIL IN OHIO, CORN</h2>
				<blockquote>
					“I treated 8 rows, left 8 untreated and repeated this pattern across
					the field. I applied the product as I cultivated the first time by
					spraying an 8” band over the row and rolling dirt to cover it as I
					cultivated. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think I saw any
					difference as the field was growing. I had been walking in it but
					didn’t see anything that looked radically different.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“Recently I went out and flagged the plots and still didn’t see
					anything that jumped out at me. I pulled 4 ears (of corn) out of a
					treated plot that weighed 46.7 oz. total. I pulled 4 ears out of the
					adjoining untreated plot that weighed 40.8 oz. total, a difference of
					5.9 oz. Calculated at 25,000 plant population that equals 20.57
					bushels at $3.25/bushel, that’s $66.85 benefit from the product.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“I pulled 4 ears from the next adjoining plot that was treated ...
					that equaled a 14.86 bushel increase.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“The treated plots had much bigger roots with the brace roots being
					much more symmetrical and larger in diameter. In fact, there were a
					good number of plants in the untreated plots that had no brace roots.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“I had two farmers that I had talked to that wanted to see the plots.
					We walked out and viewed them and I asked them to tell me what they
					saw. Both commented that the treated plots had less weeds than the
					untreated.”
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Above is a picture that Phil sent me of his corn roots. He said that
					this difference in root mass was typical when comparing the treated
					and untreated rows.

				<h2>ISAAC IN INDIANA, MOISTURE</h2>
				<blockquote>
					“I applied 64 oz. of MycorrPlus per acre in late spring. I used it on
					most of my fields, except one spot in the garden where we had peas.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“Later in the summer when the peas were gone (and it was really dry
					here then) I tilled the ground where the peas were and didn’t get any
					moisture; it was dusty and dry.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“Then I also tilled right beside it, where I had applied MycorrPlus,
					and there was enough moisture to replant. I was amazed at the
					difference. I look forward to using it again next year.”
				</blockquote>

				<h2>JOHN IN TEXAS</h2>
				<blockquote>
					“I saw an improvement in plant growth and yields. The treated area was
					more structured. The root systems were longer in the treated areas,
					plus there were white fungi strands.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“The treated soil was more moist than the untreated. We don’t see any
					fire ants in the treated area; the mounds are dying.”
				</blockquote>

				<h2>VALENTINE IN INDIANA</h2>
				<blockquote>
					“I saw improvement in plant growth and yields. More hay from fewer
					cuttings; corn & beans are not harvested yet, but it looks like an
					excellent crop.”
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					“I saw some 4-bean pods (4 beans in a pod) in the bean field, which
					I’ve never seen before, plus improved soil structure and root
					structure.”
				</blockquote>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.testimonial}>
				<h2>HARVEY IN DELAWARE</h2>
				<blockquote>
					“I applied 1 quart per acre. I saw an improvement in growth and
					yields. We used no other fertility. I pushed a metal rod into the
					treated area and it easily went down 2 feet. The treated area has more
					earthworms and less weed and insect pressure.”
				</blockquote>

				<h2>RYAN IN GEORGIA</h2>
				<blockquote>
					“I will be honest, I thought MycorrPlus was snake oil when I put it
					out. Well, I had impressive results, and better germination.”
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Below are pictures Ryan sent to show us the improvement in germination
					and growth of his Cosque Black Oats. Imagine what it could do for you!
