				<h2>RESTORING BALANCE TO THE SOIL</h2>
				<p>
					Look at the soil test results below. After an application of
					MycorrPlus (formerly Mycorr Plus) on July 4, it took only 4 months for
					phosphorus and potassium to be optimised. But no P or K were applied
					to achieve this.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the same way, no sulfur, boron, iron or copper were applied. They
					were already in the soil, just tied up. After MycorrPlus was applied,
					they suddenly showed up on the soil test.
				</p>
				<p>
					All these nutrients were brought up in the soil by employing microbes
					to make them available. You see, the soil is full of tied up
					nutrients. As soil nutrients come into balance, so does soil pH.
					MycorrPlus is usually able to restore nutritional balance to the soil
					within 24 months.
				</p>

				<h2>ESTABLISHING MICROBIAL BALANCE</h2>
				<p>
					What does MycorrPlus do to help restore beneficial microbials and
					empower a beneficial soil food web? It creates the perfect environment
					for beneficial microbes to thrive.
				</p>
				<p>
					In sick soils, pathogens thrive. Harmful nematodes that eat away at
					plant roots dominate and overwhelm beneficial nematodes. Even though
					one inoculates with mycorrhizal fungi, when the soil is out of balance
					it can simply be a waste of money.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus goes to work right away to devour chemicals, plant toxins
					and other toxins. Our microbes remediate salts and flush them out of
					the root zone. They help break down chemical loads that hinder life in
					the soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a healthy soil environment, beneficial nematodes quickly displace
					harmful ones; good bacteria multiply rapidly and displace harmful
					bacteria. Earthworms multiply in this environment and help transform
					the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi that couldn’t thrive before now create
					massive fungal networks. Andrew in Michigan told us that at the end of
					the season, when he dug up his one-acre garden, he not only found huge
					root structures but also white filaments of fungi unlike anything he
					had seen before.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>TILL LESS, EARN MORE</h2>
				<p>
					Fungi networks are fragile. The deeper the soil is tilled, the more it
					disrupts any fungi networks that may be present. Tilling also releases
					precious carbon (think organic matter) into the atmosphere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disking down one or two inches is minimally disruptive; however, the
					deeper one tills, the more damage is done to microbial networks. This
					is one of the reasons why AG-USA advocates minimal tillage or not
					tilling at all—we want to see the soil restored to balance and grow
					stronger each year.
				</p>

				<h2>THE NO-TILL FARMER’S BEST FRIEND</h2>
				<p>
					One of the greatest enemies of no-till farmers is compaction. By
					eliminating this problem, MycorrPlus makes no-till farming so much
					easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					A customer in Georgia said that after only 6 months, MycorrPlus
					structured their highly compacted soil down a full 10”. If you are a
					no-tiller, it can do the same for you! MycorrPlus microbials fill the
					soil with air gaps, softening it and allowing moisture to soak in
					instead of running off.
				</p>
				<p>
					Air flows down into the soil farther and farther, so that after 4 or 5
					months the nitrogen fixing bacteria in MycorrPlus can produce a
					wonderful supply of urea.
				</p>
				<p>
					Weeds are another enemy of no-till farmers. However, most weeds thrive
					due to problems in the soil—compaction, salts, high or low pH, and
					locked-up calcium needed to mobilize other nutrients. By addressing
					these issues, problematic weeds become less of a problem and easier to
					manage.
				</p>

				<h2>COVER CROPS? THINK $$$</h2>
				<p>
					The ground wants to be covered. When it goes uncovered for prolonged
					periods, the sun can do great harm to soil life. Carbon sequestration
					is by far the most effective method to build organic matter in the
					soil. With MycorrPlus, cover crops continue the soil-building process
					between crops. As organic matter increases, so does CEC and the soil’s
					ability to feed the plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					With MycorrPlus, cover crops not only rebuild nutrients in the soil
					but also help the soil retain moisture. Research has shown that when 8
					or more varieties of plants are used in a cover crop, a tipping point
					can be reached and moisture builds up in the soil even under dry
					conditions.

				<h2>MORE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET</h2>
				<p>
					As a bio-stimulant, MycorrPlus helps to establish mycorrhizal fungi in
					the soil, resulting in increased production and greater profitability.

				<h2>Increasing Production &amp; Profits</h2>
				<p>
					Cover crops are wonderful—they not only return nutrients and organic
					matter to the soil, but they also protect the soil from UV rays that
					can kill beneficial microbes. Mycorr Plus, a bio-stimulant, takes
					cover crops to a whole new level. When the soil is balanced and filled
					with mycorrhizal fungi, the plant sequesters huge amounts of sugars to
					feed these microbes, providing a nutrient buffet while highly
					structuring the soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					When carbon sequestration is activated, cover crops continue building
					the soil, improving its structure and organic matter content. As
					organic matter increases, so does CEC and the soil’s ability to feed
					the plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					For organic farmers, Mycorr Plus is formulated specifically for
					them—it’s listed with WSDA and costs no more than the standard
					formulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a bio-stimulant, Mycorr Plus restores soil balance, increasing
					production and profitability. Feedback from farmers has been
					overwhelmingly positive—even if it sounds too good to be true, many
					have seen dramatic improvements in their fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					Leonard, a farmer in northern Florida, used Mycorr Plus in March 2016
					and, despite a dry spell thereafter, reported that his pastures
					outperformed his neighbors’ all year round.
