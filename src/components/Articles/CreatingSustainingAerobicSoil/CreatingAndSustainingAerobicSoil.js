					Anaerobic soil microbes (microbes that don’t need oxygen) bring with
					them compaction, pathogens (disease), and a sour smelling soil.
					Anaerobic soil easily becomes water-logged, but when it dries out it
					can quickly become as hard as a rock.
				</p>
				<p>
					The end product created by anaerobic microbes is formaldehyde—the
					fluid used for embalming. Formaldehyde is not at all good for soil
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, aerobic microbes produce a wonderful “earthy”
					smell, take out compaction and make for a much healthier plant.

				<h2>Creating Aerobic Soil</h2>
				<p>
					Good farming practices—including rotational grazing, cover crops,
					balancing soil pH and soil nutrients, minimal tillage and limited use
					of chemicals—are all helpful for creating aerobic soil. Applying a
					biological can also help.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus is all about helping the soil transition to an aerobic
					state. It contains 70 strains of aerobic bacteria and 4 strains of
					mycorrhizal fungi, but it is much more than just a microbial product.
					MycorrPlus is a bio-stimulant, a food source for its aerobic microbes.
					These microbes help balance soil nutrients and pH and aggregate the
					soil so that aerobic microbes thrive.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus helps create conditions that encourage a greater amount of
					carbon sequestration. The more carbon that is sequestered, the more
					highly structured the soil will be—meaning more oxygen is available to
					support aerobic bacteria.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Rain and Aerobic Soil</h2>
				<p>
					Normal amounts of rainfall help aerobic microbes by pushing out stale,
					oxygen-depleted air. As rainwater flows deeper into the soil, it draws
					fresh, oxygen-rich air behind it.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, super saturated soil is very hard on aerobic microbes.
					Although water does contain a small amount of oxygen, it is quickly
					used up. Once super saturated, the soil becomes depleted of oxygen and
					aerobic microbes can drown.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, there’s a constant battle between aerobic and anaerobic
					microbes—and between beneficial microbes and pathogens. When the soil
					is super saturated for more than a few days, anaerobic bacteria start
					to take over, making it a challenge to restore aerobic dominance.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, when conditions favor beneficial microbes, they
					will thrive and reclaim the soil from pathogens and anaerobic
					microbes. Once again, MycorrPlus helps by highly structuring the soil
					and creating conditions for beneficial microbes.
				</p>

				<h2>Restoring Aerobic Soil</h2>
				<p>
					Has your ground been water saturated for a week or more? Once things
					dry out a little, you can apply a quart of MycorrPlus ($20 per acre)
					to help quickly turn things around.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elaine in Georgia experienced this on 100 acres of flat, exposed land
					hit hard by 5 days of frost. After applying a quart of MycorrPlus on
					April 4th, Elaine reported on July 9th that her fields showed no
					difference—her grass was thicker and the clover was still thriving.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gideon in Pennsylvania applied a quart in June 2017, and despite a
					cold, wet spring that stressed his grass, a subsequent application
					after the soil dried helped restore aerobic microbial dominance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps your fields could use a boost—either in creating an aerobic
					condition or restoring it. Please consider MycorrPlus. Keep in mind
					that summer and fall are excellent times to apply it.
