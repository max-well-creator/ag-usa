					Here's How MycorrPlus-A and O Help Keep Grass Growing Even During Dry
					Spells
				</h2>
				<ol style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
					<li style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>
						<strong>MycorrPlus fills the soil with beneficial microbes:</strong>
						<p>
							MycorrPlus is a bio-stimulant that helps beneficial microbes
							restore harmony and balance to the soil. It inoculates the soil
							with over 70 beneficial aerobic bacteria, fungi (including
							mycorrhizal fungi), and other microbes. With adequate moisture (at
							least 1.1"), these microbes become established. MycorrPlus also
							contains sea minerals, fish, kelp, humic and fulvic acids, and
							numerous other nutrients—all in a wonderfully balanced nutrient
							solution.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>
						<strong>Beneficial microbes transform the soil:</strong>
						<p>
							They consume or displace harmful elements such as destructive
							nematodes, anaerobic disease-causing bacteria, plant toxins, old
							weed seed, salts, and chemicals. Mycorrhizal fungi form
							ever-enlarging webs that transport nutrients and moisture to
							plants. Earthworms, dung beetles, and other Soil Food Web members
							multiply, further transforming the soil and creating greater soil
							energy.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>
						<strong>
							Plants sequester Liquid Carbon to Free Up Soil Nutrients:
						</strong>
						<p>
							Favorable soil conditions prompt plants to sequester massive
							amounts of sugars (liquid carbon) into the soil, cultivating and
							feeding the microbes. Mycorrhizal plants photosynthesize much
							faster than those not supported by mycorrhizal fungi. By reducing
							tillage, more mycorrhizal networks form, releasing ever-increasing
							carbon sequestration.
						</p>
						<p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
							(Andrew in Michigan reported that after applying MycorrPlus in
							July on his acre of vegetables, not only did his produce win
							awards at the Farmer's Market, but his soil exhibited massive root
							structures and an amazing network of mycorrhizal fungi.)
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>
						<strong>
							Microbes use liquid carbon to highly structure the soil:
						</strong>
						<p>
							Microbes feed on the sequestered sugars and use them as gums and
							glues to bind soil particles together. This process rapidly builds
							organic matter (including humus), deepens topsoil, increases
							moisture storage, and boosts the soil's CEC (cation exchange
							capacity).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>
						<strong>Highly structured soil means extra nitrogen:</strong>
						<p>
							As soil microbes flocculate the soil, they create trillions of air
							spaces. These spaces allow air, which is 78% nitrogen, to flow
							into the soil. MycorrPlus contains Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria that
							convert this atmospheric nitrogen into forms available to the
							plant—resulting in extra nitrogen in the soil.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style={{ marginBottom: "15px" }}>
						<strong>Highly structured soil means lots of moisture!</strong>
						<p>
							With improved soil structure, moisture is held in the air spaces
							rather than running off. Some research suggests that certain
							bacteria also help attract and fix moisture from the air,
							contributing to improved sub-soil moisture even during dry spells.

				<h2>To Recap:</h2>
				<ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
					<li>
						MycorrPlus-A and O act like a center pivot for dryland farmers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Beneficial microbes in MycorrPlus remediate soil problems and
						establish thriving mycorrhizal networks.
					</li>
					<li>
						They "turn on the carbon sequestration switch" in the plant, causing
						huge amounts of liquid carbon to be secreted into the soil.
					</li>
					<li>
						Microbes use this liquid carbon to glue soil particles together,
						creating highly structured soil with excellent moisture retention.
					</li>
					<li>
						More consistent soil moisture results in more consistent yields—and
						more money in your pocket.
