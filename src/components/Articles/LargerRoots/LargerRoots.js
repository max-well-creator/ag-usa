					One of the greatest difficulties in farming is the weather. Many other
					things can be controlled or remedied, but not hot, cold, wind, rain
					and hail.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem can be especially difficult for the dryland farmer. What
					do you do when a dry spell comes? Crops stop growing and yields
					suffer.
				</p>

				<h2>A SOLUTION FOR DRY SPELLS</h2>
				<p>
					How about a special type of aerobic bacteria that produce water as a
					by-product of its respiration?
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, even humans manufacture moisture when we breathe. That’s why our
					breath can fog up our eyeglasses. MycorrPlus (previously named GroPal
					Balance) has anionically charged bacteria that leave a trail of
					moisture as they travel through the soil.
				</p>

					Elaine and her husband farm 1,100 acres in southern Georgia and
					northern Florida. Around the first of July, 2016, they applied a
					bio-stimulant called MycorrPlus to their pastures and grass hay
					fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elaine said that 2016 had been a particularly dry year, and in fields
					all around them grass had turned brown.
				</p>
				<p>
					But in their fields the grass was green all the way down to the roots,
					and continued to grow. In fact, while their neighbors were feeding
					hay, Elaine said that their cattle couldn’t keep up with their grass.
					Elaine took before and after soil samples (see results in the box
					below).
				</p>
				<p>
					With the 2nd soil sample she was surprised to find moisture at 5”. She
					concluded that this was why they still had green grass in spite of dry
					weather.
				</p>

					“Drought tolerance is so much better. I drive by several pastures on
					my way home every night. Of course, you don’t like to compare with
					your neighbors, but there’s a distinct difference. I’m rather excited
					about it.”

				<h2>CORN AND SUNFLOWERS</h2>
				<p>
					Last year a farmer in Nebraska called and ordered more MycorrPlus.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2015, Mark applied $100 of fertilization per acre. In 2016 he put a
					quart per acre of MycorrPlus on his corn and sunflowers. Mark said
					that 2016 had been a little dryer, but fortunately his sunflowers and
					corn were irrigated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although in 2016 Mark applied nothing but MycorrPlus, he said his
					organic blue corn yielded 20% more and his sunflowers yielded 25% more
					than in 2015. Besides this, he mentioned they had better color and
					vigor.
				</p>
				<p>
					“They just weren’t as vigorous before,” he said. His dad commented,
					“This stuff sure does work!”
				</p>
				<p>
					Where Mark applied MycorrPlus on his pasture, he said his Canadian
					Thistles turned yellow, and his buffalo ate them right down to the
					soil. He figured that the MycorrPlus made them more palatable.

				<h2>LARGER ROOT STRUCTURES</h2>
				<p>
					Larry in Mississippi grows conventional soybeans. He said that his
					beans had a huge root mass. A customer in Michigan noted the same with
					his one-acre garden and mentioned that the soil was filled with fungi.
					Add to this more moisture, and you can see why farmers are having
					better yields – more moisture does mean better yields!
				</p>
				<p>
					Is compaction a problem? MycorrPlus helps to highly structure the
					soil. Standing water a problem? The longer MycorrPlus has to work, the
					less water you will see standing in your fields. Water soaks in, which
					means it is then available when there are spells without rain.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those of you who have too much moisture, MycorrPlus can help with
					that, too. It highly structures the soil so that moisture soaks in
					deeper and deeper. The farther moisture can go into the ground, the
					less likely it is to saturate the soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus costs $20 an acre for pastures, $40 an acre for most other
					crops. It mixes quickly with no clogging of spray equipment.
				</p>

					Check us out online, or call today and request a free information
					packet! You’ll be glad you did.
