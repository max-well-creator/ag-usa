				The Best Way to Neutralize Soil pH (and save a ton of money on lime!)
			</h1>
			<p>
				Soil pH is the measurement of hydrogen ions in the soil. Keeping
				hydrogen ions in balance is crucial for the health and productivity of
				the plant.

				<h2>1. Aglime is NOT the Best Way to Balance pH</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Aglime is commonly used to supply available calcium and correct low
						pH, but it creates several problems:
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Surface lime applications only correct the topsoil pH, leaving the
							subsoil untreated.
						</li>
						<li>
							It can be expensive to apply the full amount of lime recommended
							by soil tests.
						</li>
						<li>
							Lime can take up to 3 years to fully react in the soil, sometimes
							leading to over-application.
						</li>
						<li>
							Over-application of lime can create long-term problems that are
							difficult to correct.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h2>2. Balancing the Soil IS the Key</h2>
				<p>
					To correct soil pH effectively, we must balance not only available
					calcium but all the minerals in the soil. The term "pH" stands for
					"potential hydrogen"—the amount of hydrogen ions in the soil. When all
					minerals come into balance, hydrogen ions naturally do too.
				</p>
				<h3>a. Soils Have Enough Calcium</h3>
				<p>
					In fact, most soils contain an abundance of calcium. The real issue is
					that the calcium (like many other nutrients) is not available. What we
					need is to bring all the minerals into balance, which will in turn
					balance the pH.
				</p>
				<h3>b. Aerobic Bacteria are the Answer</h3>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus contains 70 strains of specialized aerobic bacteria and 4
					strains of mycorrhizal fungi. Although MycorrPlus is a bio-stimulant
					(a food source to help our microbes colonize the soil), its true power
					is in establishing a thriving microbial community.
				</p>
				<p>Once established, these bacteria:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create air spaces in the soil through flocculation, essential for
						oxygen and moisture retention.
					</li>
					<li>
						Free up minerals, establishing a perfect mineral balance that
						includes available calcium.
					</li>
					<li>Help create a moist, pathogen-free, low-saline environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As the microbes balance the soil nutrients, pH naturally comes into
					balance, even if it was initially too high or too low.
				</p>
				<h3>c. Balancing pH Deep in the Soil</h3>
				<p>
					While surface lime only affects the topsoil, microbial balancing works
					deep in the soil, bringing all minerals into harmony.
				</p>

				<h2>3. Why It Is Important to Maintain Neutral Soil pH</h2>
				<h3>Problems with High Soil pH</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						High alkalinity severely limits plant growth by reducing the
						availability of nutrients like iron, boron, zinc, manganese, copper,
						and phosphorus.
					</li>
					<li>
						High calcium levels can inhibit magnesium and potassium uptake.
					</li>
					<li>Even sulfur applications can take a long time to lower pH.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Problems with Low Soil pH</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Acidic soils tie up phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, sulfur,
						manganese, and calcium, reducing plant growth.
					</li>
					<li>Reduced microbial activity and poor nodulation in legumes.</li>
					<li>
						Excess nitrogen can exacerbate acidity by leaving behind hydrogen
						ions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Acidic conditions can increase aluminum solubility, further stunting
						root growth.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					We believe it is far better to restore balance to all the minerals in
					the soil—which naturally increases available calcium and balances
					pH—than to rely on lime. And does it really work? Yes, it does!
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, Elaine took soil samples in mid-May, applied MycorrPlus
					at the end of June, and then retested in November. Without using any
					lime in 2015 and switching to MycorrPlus in 2016, her treated fields
					showed remarkable improvements:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Soil probes measured 5-6 inches of penetration in treated fields
						compared to none in the control field.
					</li>
					<li>
						Lab tests confirmed that the pH reached 7.0, and most other minerals
						came into balance.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					It takes about 2 years (with a 1–2 quart application per year) for
					MycorrPlus to completely restore soil balance.
