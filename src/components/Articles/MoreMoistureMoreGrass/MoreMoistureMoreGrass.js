					In Florida, the Mycorr Plus side of the field “kept coming on.” In
					early winter, Richard invited me to see for myself. True enough, the
					Mycorr Plus half was a good 18” tall and laying over, while the other
					half was about 8” tall and more sparse. The root mass on the treated
					side was also significantly larger.

					Richard also observed a remarkable increase in earthworms—unlike
					anything he had ever seen. An agronomist friend in North Florida even
					remarked, “We don’t have earthworms here in North Florida sugar sand.”

					Just last week, a farmer in Nebraska called to place another order for
					Mycorr Plus. In 2015, Mark applied 10 gallons of fish per acre along
					with some biologicals and enzymes. In 2016, he broadcast 16 ounces of
					Mycorr Plus and then applied another 16 ounces in the row on the seed.
					Despite a particularly dry year, his corn and sunflowers—under
					irrigation—yielded 20% and 25% more, respectively, than in 2015. He
					also noted better color and vigor; as he put it, “They just weren’t as
					vigorous before.” His dad even commented, “This stuff sure does work!”

					Where Mark applied Mycorr Plus on his pasture, he noted that his
					Canadian Thistles turned yellow and his buffalo ate them right down to
					the soil—indicating that the product made them more palatable.

					Larry in Mississippi grows conventional soybeans and reported huge
					root structures in his beans. A customer in Michigan had a similar
					experience in his one-acre garden, noting an amazing mycorrhizal fungi
					network.

					Add to huge root structures a lot more moisture, and you can see why
					farmers have more grass. More moisture does mean more grass!
