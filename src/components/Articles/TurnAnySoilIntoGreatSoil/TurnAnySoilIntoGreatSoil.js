				<p className={styles.subtitle}>
					Healthy soil is soil that is alive. For farms and gardens, healthy
					soil is the key to almost everything – from greater nutrient
					availability (using less fertilizer) and drought tolerance to weed
					control, nutrient dense plants, and healthy livestock. For better
					yields and increased production, great soil is the answer.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.intro}>
					I would like to show you how to make your soil, any soil, great again!

				<h2>Highly Structuring the Soil</h2>
				<p>
					Compacted soil is soil that is struggling. It contains very little
					oxygen, so anaerobic microbes thrive. The best way to reduce soil
					compaction is by using aerobic microbes – microbes that breathe oxygen
					like you and I.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus is a bio-stimulant that helps establish aerobic microbes in
					the soil. These bacteria, fungi, and beneficial nematodes – along with
					the resulting multiplication of earthworms – quickly reduce compaction
					by creating tiny air pockets. Would you like to know how they do this?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						MycorrPlus contains 70 species of highly specialized aerobic
						bacteria. As they pass through the soil, they emit a sticky
						substance.
					</li>
					<li>
						It also helps mycorrhizal fungi and earthworms to multiply, and they
						too emit a sticky substance.
					</li>
					<li>
						All of these sticky substances bind soil particles together,
						eliminating compaction.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					So, how does MycorrPlus work with various soil types? Could it help to
					make your soil great again?
				</p>

				<h2>Sandy Soil</h2>
				<p>
					Sandy soil is lighter than other soils. It has low organic matter and
					CEC and doesn’t hold nutrients or moisture well. MycorrPlus helps to
					change that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Richard Fish from northern Florida applied MycorrPlus to half a field
					of pasture in March 2015. During the heat of summer – when his grass
					normally declines – the treated side continued to grow. By early
					November, the treated grass was 18” tall compared to around 8” on the
					untreated side, which was thinner and browner.
				</p>
				<p>
					In another field sown into oats, Richard noted that he could hardly
					take a step without stepping on earthworm castings. An agronomist
					friend explained, “We don’t have earthworms in North Florida sugar
					sand.” But after using MycorrPlus, that changed!
				</p>
				<p>
					Richard also observed that when he went to scrape manure from his
					pasture, none was visible – the earthworms and dung beetles had
					carried it down into the soil. When sandy soil is highly structured,
					it retains nutrients and moisture better, making plants more
					nutritious and helping the soil endure dry spells.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Clay Soil</h2>
				<p>
					Clay soil is heavy and has very small particle sizes. Although it
					takes longer to structure clay soil, the results can be amazing! A
					customer in Georgia noted that by the end of the year, the area
					sprayed with MycorrPlus allowed a probe to penetrate 6” deep, while
					the untreated area only allowed 1”. When he turned over a spade of his
					normally red clay, he observed it was turning dark.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus helps balance soil nutrients and greatly enhances carbon
					sequestration by the plant. As the plant sequesters sugars to feed
					soil microbes, it builds organic matter – and remember, carbon is
					organic matter.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Sandy Loam Soil</h2>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus also helps transform loam and sandy loam soils. John from
					Texas reported improved plant growth during the dry summer period.
					“During the summer, treated areas are damp to about 18”, compared to
					2” to 6” in untreated areas. Even heavy rains didn’t cause ponding in
					the treated areas.”
				</p>
				<p>
					As the microbes in MycorrPlus structure the soil, moisture penetrates
					deeper. Then, mycorrhizae carry the moisture back up to the plant as
					needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					John observed greater root mass – including hair roots and rhizomes –
					and noted, “My pH has improved from a low 5 to almost 6.”
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Other Soil Types</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>In saline soils, MycorrPlus microbes help remediate salts.</li>
					<li>
						In soils with low pH, the microbes help balance nutrients in the
						soil, raising the pH without the need for lime.
					</li>
					<li>
						In high pH soils, balanced soil nutrients result in a lower pH.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Success Story: Transforming Poor Soil</h2>
				<p>
					In August 2017, our customers began to see dramatic changes in fields
					with poor soil. According to Elaine, until last June the fields on
					both sides looked the same—a mere splotch of grass here and there.
					John, another customer, sowed seeds on both fields, but nothing grew
					on the poor soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then in mid-June, John removed the cows and on the first of July
					applied Mycorr Plus to one field. He later shared, “Before we applied
					Mycorr Plus, you could see patches of dirt and bare soil. Now, the
					field is totally covered.”
				</p>
				<p>
					After bringing the cows back on August 15th, during the next two
					months, the field saw tremendous growth: the grass reached 18” to 20”
					tall and lay over. Grazing continued into December, and John was
					amazed by the growth, saying it made him a believer in the product.
				</p>
				<p>
					John also noted improvements in livestock appearance. Before GroPal
					Balance, his horses had rough coats and fragile hooves. Now, their
					coats are shinier, they shed sooner, and their hooves appear much
					healthier, almost as if they were being fed grain.
				</p>
