				<p>
					Why is root mass important to the farmer? The size of plant roots is a
					key factor in determining the uptake of nutrients by the plant, plant
					growth, and the ability of the plant to survive dry spells. Do you
					want more roots?
				</p>

				<h2>Only Take the Top of the Plant</h2>
				<p>
					Whether grazing or cutting for hay, it is helpful not to take more
					than half of the height of the plant—and even better to only take the
					top third.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to research (Crider, 1955), removing too much of the plant
					causes plant roots to stop growing. When you take half or less than
					half of the plant, none of the roots stop growing. When you take 70%
					of the plant, 50% of the plant’s roots will not grow for 17 days. When
					you take 90% of the plant, it will totally shut down root development
					for 17 days (see picture).
				</p>

				<h2>Rotational Grazing Does Help</h2>
				<p>
					Recently a farmer told me that he generally rotates his cows between
					two fields. But when he stopped that rotation, he was surprised to see
					just how much less grass his fields produced.
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s true. Although it may be labor intensive, rotational grazing can
					greatly increase root structure, resulting in greater production. This
					is especially true when livestock aren’t left on a field long enough
					to eat more than 50% of the plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rotational grazing is also a tool to help reduce intestinal worms.
					Worms enter the soil through cattle manure and lay eggs. These eggs
					grow to worms, but if there is no animal present to host them, they
					soon die. The cycle of the worm is broken.
				</p>
				<p>
					The more often that livestock are moved, the greater the benefits. For
					those who have the time and energy to do so, mob grazing takes root
					and plant development to a whole new level.
				</p>
				<ul className={styles.bulletList}>
					<li>
						<strong>Dr. Christine Jones has found that</strong> the trampling of
						plants during mob grazing really helps to stimulate plant growth.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>She also found</strong> that it has a profound effect on
						retaining soil moisture.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>With mob grazing</strong>, cow pies are trampled, which
						helps reduce the number of flies.

				<h2>MycorrPlus Produces Larger Roots</h2>
				<p>
					Bill in Ohio said: “We had quite a few large-size potatoes; quite a
					few were larger than my hand—7 to 8 inches long and 1 to 1.25 lbs.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Roger in Wisconsin loves to show off his 5 lb. rutabaga. That’s huge!
					Good job, Roger.
				</p>
				<p>
					Darrell in Georgia said: “We found lots of earthworms, low compaction
					and deep roots.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Ryan in Georgia said: “We had deeper root systems on our Cosque Black
					Oats. They averaged 50 grams per plant compared to 14 grams in the
					control.” (See picture below)
				</p>
				<p>
					Diane in Mississippi said: “Our plants have a better root system now.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Jim in New York said: “My sweet potatoes were large and well formed, a
					bumper crop!”
				</p>
				<p>
					Phil in Ohio said that the root system on his corn was appreciably
					better on treated soil. Brace roots were more uniform and larger in
					size compared to untreated (see below).
				</p>
				<p>
					Warren in Kentucky said: “I do think the root system is better; there
					are plenty of tiny roots reaching to the surface of the ground.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Kristin in Georgia said: “Root structure is much better with thicker
					clumps.”
				</p>
				<p>
					David in Iowa had an amazing carrot harvest, including a 2-foot
					carrot! He said they came out of the ground easily, and the soil
					didn’t stick.
				</p>
				<p>
					Levi in Indiana noticed big roots in his tomatoes and better yields
					than most years.

				<h2>Extending Roots With Fungi</h2>
				<p>
					You don’t usually find mycorrhizal fungi in farm ground, but when they
					flourish, they greatly enhance the efficiency of plant roots,
					including their ability to take up nutrients and water.
				</p>
				<p>
					Farmers are finding that one of the benefits of MycorrPlus is that it
					helps create conditions in the soil where mycorrhizal fungi flourish.
				</p>
				<ul className={styles.bulletList}>
					<li>
						Bill in Ohio said that he now sees fungi on the organic matter and
						in the soil.
					</li>
					<li>Ryan in Georgia has mycorrhizal fungi mushrooms everywhere.</li>
					<li>
						John in Iowa said: “In the past, I have struggled trying to get
						fungi to develop in my soil. But the areas treated with MycorrPlus
						show signs of fungal strands and the litter layer has a lot of
						fungal growth on it.”
					</li>
					<li>Warren in Kentucky said he is seeing some fungi now.</li>
					<li>
						Ben in Wisconsin said they had a lot of white fungi on their bunched
						beets.
					</li>
					<li>
						Daniel in Iowa said: “I saw mycorrhizae in the root zone and had my
						best soybeans ever.”
					</li>
					<li>
						Andrew in Michigan said: “I was blown away by the mycorrhizal fungi
						all over the roots of our plants.”
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus not only helps a plant develop a huge root system, but it
					also helps establish mycorrhizal fungi, which far extend the reach of
					the roots.
