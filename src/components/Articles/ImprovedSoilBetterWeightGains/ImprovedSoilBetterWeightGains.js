					My dad, Paul Schneider Sr., is a retired animal nutritionist who
					worked with farmers primarily in Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado.
					Although he valued university testing, he preferred the results from
					“Farmer University.” It is one thing for a university to say your
					product works, but when so many of your customers consistently have
					good results, that is where the rubber meets the road.

				<h2>John and Elaine, GA</h2>
				<p>
					John and Elaine have an 1,100-acre cow/calf operation. They initially
					applied MycorrPlus soil amendment (formerly GroPal Balance) in July of
					2016 to address a compaction problem. Now in their third year of using
					MycorrPlus (my-core-plus), they’ve seen not only reduced compaction
					but many other benefits:
				</p>
				<h3>Nov. 2016 (Four Months After Application)</h3>
				<p>
					“What we are seeing is that the pasture is beginning to be thicker. A
					friend of ours that has had the same amount of rain has run out of
					grass and is feeding hay, while we have more grass than we can
					actually use for the number of cattle that we have.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“The compaction is getting better. Before MycorrPlus we had a lot of
					runoff, but not as much now. I believe this decrease in compaction is
					one of the reasons the rain is going in better, causing the grass to
					do better. I am really excited about what MycorrPlus is doing for us.”
				</p>

				<h3>Feb. 2017 (7 Months After Application)</h3>
				<p>
					“I believe the sea minerals in MycorrPlus will increase fertility. We
					have heifers. Last year we had 5 sets of paternal twins, which is
					unheard of. Last year our 208 cows bred 224 calves.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Our cows bred in a shorter period of time last year, and this year
					110 out of 159 were born in the first 30 days of calving. The sea
					minerals in MycorrPlus really make a difference in re-breeding!”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Last spring we had 10 calves in the barn, but this year just one.
					Over the winter our calves haven't drawn down, but are very fit. Our
					cows are the best looking they have ever been in mid-February. They
					should be a 5 to 6 body score for re-breeding, and they are already a
					6.”

				<h3>Feb. 2018 Interview with Elaine</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Fertility – Stronger Heats</strong>
					<br />
					Paul: So, you said that on a scale of 1 to 5 for readiness for
					insemination, 33 out of 38 of your calves were 5’s in February?
					<br />
					Elaine: These calves were born primarily in January and February of
					last year. Our Reproductive Specialist here in Georgia just hasn’t
					seen 5’s before in February. He even said, “Oh man, would this group
					of heifers do good on artificial insemination.” But I just use the
					bull.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul: When most of your calves are born within a month, it means the
					heats are stronger and more consistent.
					<br />
					Elaine: Exactly – the heats are stronger, they're cycling together,
					and their reproductive tracts are already developed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul: Other customers have seen this too. We had a dairy in Canada
					where he said, “It normally takes me 3 months to breed half the herd.
					But with your product, it was done in two weeks.”
					<br />
					Elaine: And the closer together you can get those calves on the
					ground, the better the uniformity and the higher the price you get
					when selling them in truckloads.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Calves Gaining Weight Faster</strong>
					<br />
					Paul: And these heifers, in February, are already 8's – 800 weights?
					<br />
					Elaine: Yes, most of them are already at 8 weights. When the
					Reproductive Specialist asked, “How old are these heifers?” I said,
					“They were born last January, February, and March.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul: So within a year, they’re already at 800 weights? That's
					amazing!
					<br />
					Elaine: Yes. I mentioned in September about the weaning rate – 43
					heifers weaned at 633 pounds, roughly at 207 days old.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul: These are weight gains usually seen in farmers who feed grain.
					<br />
					Elaine: My goal is to wean a 700–750 pound calf. Most people wean
					calves at 300–400 pounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						(Editor’s note: A year and a half after using MycorrPlus to build up
						their soil, John and Elaine observed that, whereas it normally took
						their calves until April to reach 600–700 pounds, in February of
						2018 their calves were 800 pounds. Elaine attributes much of this
						improvement to MycorrPlus.)
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Elaine’s calves are now breeding a month earlier each year.
					<br />
					Paul: It is now February – you mentioned most calves were born in
					January?
					<br />
					Elaine: They come in thirds – January, February, and March. Last year,
					most were born in January and February. This is our third year on
					MycorrPlus, and most came in January.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul: So next year you'll start breeding earlier, with calves born in
					November instead of January?
					<br />
					Elaine: Exactly – next year I’ll put the bulls in by March 1st, and
					the following year by February 1st.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elaine: I was so excited when the Reproductive Specialist asked, “What
					are you doing to get these cows cycling like this?” I said, “It’s
					their diet – the mamas and the calves are on the grass together. It’s
					all about MycorrPlus.”
					<br />
					Paul: Yes, it’s the nutrients in the grass.
					<br />
					Elaine: It’s MycorrPlus – the balancing of the soil. I was so excited
					I just had to share the good news!

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
					John and Elaine have Solomon-like wisdom in managing their cow/calf
					operation. No wonder 10 of their friends have followed their advice
					and now use MycorrPlus on their pastures and hay fields. Many
					customers tell us their cows can’t keep up with their grass –
					indicating a higher stocking rate. Just like John and Elaine,
					MycorrPlus can help improve your soil, leading to better weight gains
					and enhanced animal fertility.
