					When Mark in Nebraska used MycorrPlus (formerly called GroPal Balance)
					in 2016, his corn yielded 20% more and his sunflowers yielded 25%
					more. Numerous individuals like Mark have seen that MycorrPlus works
					well on irrigated land.

				<p>
					Unfortunately, for the dryland farmer it is less likely to have an
					abundance of moisture throughout the growing season. Recently, a
					farmer told me that if a rain would just last an extra week, it would
					help a lot. Perhaps some of you can relate with this.

				<h2>Retaining Moisture &amp; Eliminating Compaction</h2>
				<p>
					Is there anything that farmers can do to retain moisture while at the
					same time getting rid of compaction? Yes! Let's take a look at a
					possible solution.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>PUT FUNGI TO WORK</h2>
				<p>
					Last year I traveled to Albertville, Alabama, to attend the South Poll
					Cattle Association meeting. One of the speakers stated that it’s best
					to have a ratio of 50% bacteria to 50% fungi in the soil. In fact,
					fungi are key to helping us get rid of compaction and to highly
					structure the soil—structuring it magnifies the soil’s ability to
					retain moisture.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bad news is, fungi don’t normally thrive in farm land; they thrive
					in soils in wooded areas, where there is plenty of decaying wood to
					feed on. So, how can we get fungi to thrive where we farm? Easy! Just
					arrange for the plant to feed the fungi.
				</p>
				<p>But how do we accomplish this?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Remove toxins and salts that inhibit beneficial fungi.</li>
					<li>Bring nutrient balance to the soil.</li>
					<li>
						Empower the plant to sequester large amounts of sugars to feed
						mycorrhizal fungi.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus is designed to do all of these things and more. It’s a
					bio-stimulant that can:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Empower microbes to gobble up toxins.</li>
					<li>Flush salts from the root zone.</li>
					<li>Balance soil nutrients.</li>
					<li>Maximize the sugars sequestered by the plant.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In short, MycorrPlus helps create a friendly environment in the soil
					where mycorrhizal fungi can thrive.
				</p>

				<h2>SEQUESTER MORE CARBON, RETAIN MORE MOISTURE</h2>
				<p>
					Aerobic microbes require oxygen and moisture to thrive. With the right
					help, they build incredible structure in the soil—an environment where
					oxygen circulates freely and moisture is stored efficiently. This is
					the same environment that plants need.
				</p>
				<p>
					As plants sequester sugars to feed the microbes, these microbes use
					the residue as gums and glues to bind soil particles together,
					creating air compartments about 1/4” to 3/8” in size.
				</p>
				<p>
					In highly structured soil, rain soaks deeply into these air pockets
					and is stored until needed. In contrast, in tight, clumped soil the
					top 6” becomes water-logged, leaving the soil dry and hard once the
					water evaporates.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>BUILD ORGANIC MATTER</h2>
				<p>
					When the right conditions are created in the soil, the plant can
					sequester enough sugars to build an inch of new topsoil each year.
					Approximately 90% of the ingredients needed for photosynthesis—carbon,
					oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen—are in the air. Carbon is organic
					matter, and organic matter is carbon.
				</p>
				<p>
					When MycorrPlus empowers the plant to sequester huge amounts of sugars
					(liquid carbon), organic matter in the soil can increase by as much as
					0.5% per year. For instance, in just 8 years, a farm in Oregon went
					from 0.4% to 4.7% organic matter.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>UNLOCK SOIL NUTRIENTS</h2>
				<p>
					Mycorrhizal fungi help unlock phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and
					numerous trace minerals bound up in the soil. As microbes digest these
					nutrients, they break chemical bonds and make them available to the
					plant. Up to 97% of soil nutrients are tied up, and MycorrPlus helps
					unlock this gold mine.
