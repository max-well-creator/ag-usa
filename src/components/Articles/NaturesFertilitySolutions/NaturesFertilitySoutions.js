				<h1>Conquer Nature by Cooperating with it</h1>
			</header>

			<section className={styles.introduction}>
				<p>
					Why not let nature supply more of your NPK, Ca, moisture, etc. Nature
					has many answers for fertility; it is simply our job to cooperate with
					it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sure, cooperating with nature isn’t always easy, but the more we learn
					how to take advantage of the solutions it offers, the better the
					outcome. MycorrPlus was created to maximize our cooperation with
					nature. Here is a little of nature’s plan for soil fertility.
				</p>

				<h2>An Abundance of Nitrogen</h2>
				<p>
					There are at least 3 natural ways to enrich the earth with nitrogen:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Nitrogen fixing bacteria</li>
					<li>Nitrogen fixing plants (legumes)</li>
					<li>Animal urine and manure</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus is a biostimulant that contains nitrogen fixing bacteria.
					It takes a good 4 to 5 months for these bacteria to transform the soil
					enough to meet the nitrogen needs of most plants. The wise use of
					legumes and manures further fortify the soil with nitrogen.
				</p>
				<p>
					If they have applied nitrogen in the past and the soil has become
					“addicted” to it, corn and wheat farmers may still need to apply some.
					MycorrPlus helps to stabilize a nitrogen application so it doesn’t
					wick off or leach out, thus allowing you to apply less.
				</p>

				<h2>Tapping into Phosphorus</h2>
				<p>
					A good acre of farm ground contains enough phosphorus to last a
					hundred years. But phosphorus is quick to react with other minerals in
					the soil. There is a lot in the soil, but it is tied up and
					unavailable to the plant. Nature has the solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, there are soil microbes that “eat” phosphorus; they digest it.
					This breaks the chemical bond and makes phosphorus available.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, although phosphorus is not mobile in the soil, mycorrhizal
					fungi are able to transport it long distances, taking it directly into
					the plant’s root. MycorrPlus activates the above process.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Mycorrhizae Require Special Care</h2>
				<p>
					Because of our farming practices, it is actually rare to find
					mycorrhizal fungi in farm land. Here are some of the things that set
					mycorrhizae back:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Plowing.</strong> Working the soil breaks up fungi networks,
						not allowing them to really develop. Minimal tillage protects them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Bare soil.</strong> Mycorrhizal fungi get their nourishment
						from sugars sequestered by the plant. When the soil is left bare for
						an extended period of time, they have no food. Cover crops satisfy
						this need.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Phosphorus applications.</strong> When phosphorus is low in
						the root zone, the plant is highly motivated to sequester sugars in
						exchange for phosphorus. Mycorrhizal fungi feed these sugars to
						phosphorus digesting bacteria. This not only makes phosphorus
						available, but it rapidly builds organic matter in the soil.
						Applying phosphorus fertilizers hinders this soil building.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>“Cides” kill microbes.</strong> Pesticides, nematicides,
						fungicides and herbicides all take their toll on soil microbes.
						MycorrPlus is able to break these down and restore soil life. Just
						apply it after the chemical.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

				<h2>Mycorrhizal Fungi &amp; Encouraging Their Growth</h2>
				<p>MycorrPlus Helps Mycorrhizal Fungi by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Helping to balance the soil</li>
					<li>Cleaning up toxins</li>
					<li>Remediating salts</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Other ways to encourage mycorrhizae:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Manures and grazing. Apply some manure or allow animals to graze.
					</li>
					<li>
						Establish multiple species of plants. Mycorrhizal fungi create a
						community under the soil that links various types of plants
						together. Each species helps the other, and are also helpful to the
						fungi.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cover crops. Mycorrhizae are dependent on plants to feed them. Keep
						something growing so that they are continuously fed, allowing them
						to develop more fully.
					</li>
					<li>
						Give it time. Applying MycorrPlus each year helps to establish a
						more complex mycorrhizal organism. Third and fourth-year customers
						are amazed with the differences they are now seeing with pH,
						nutrients, clover growth and soil tilth.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Natural Sources of Potassium</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Manures are a good source of potassium.</li>
					<li>Potassium is a major component of clay.</li>
					<li>
						MycorrPlus helps to optimize and make available potassium that is
						already in the soil.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Making Calcium Available</h2>
				<p>
					Most soils contain a lot of calcium; it is just tied up. If the soil
					does contain calcium, the microbes in MycorrPlus will help free it up,
					making it available to the plant. This can really save on lime, plus
					balance pH.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Enhancing Moisture</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>When it rains, water soaks in.</li>
					<li>The soil becomes a larger water bank.</li>
					<li>
						Mycorrhizal fungi are able to transport moisture to the plant from
						deep in the soil.
					</li>
				</ul>
