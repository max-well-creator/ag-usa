				<h1>Learn the Secret to Transform Your Soil</h1>
				<p>
					What is the secret of transforming your soil? Put mycorrhizal fungi to
					work. When you get them working, everything else works, too. When they
					thrive, it helps to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Eliminate compaction.</li>
					<li>Highly structure the soil.</li>
					<li>Efficiently store moisture and transport it to the plant.</li>
					<li>
						Unlock calcium, phosphorus, and potassium from deep within your soil
						and transport them to the plant.
					</li>
					<li>Reduce the need for fertilizer.</li>
					<li>Substantially increase yields.</li>
					<li>
						Make the plant more resistant to invasion by insects and disease.
					</li>
					<li>Eliminate harmful nematodes.</li>
					<li>Quickly increase organic matter.</li>
				</ul>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<p>
					If mycorrhizal fungi can do all of this, then why aren’t more farmers
					benefiting from them? Good question. An even better question is, how
					can you put mycorrhizae to work? You must feed mycorrhizae.
				</p>
				<p>
					Normally, fungi do best in wooded areas, where they can feed on fallen
					trees. But in the absence of trees, what food source is there for
					them?
				</p>
				<p>
					When God created the world, He established the basis for a complex
					relationship between plants and soil. The potential has always been
					there—we have the opportunity to learn how to work with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this plant/soil relationship, the plant manufactures sugars to feed
					the micro-organisms in the soil. In turn, these organisms create a
					wonderful growing environment for the plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is the sugars manufactured through photosynthesis that are the
					perfect food for mycorrhizae—and the only way they will ever truly
					thrive in farm soil.
				</p>

				<h2>Other Things Mycorrhizae Need</h2>
				<p>
					You can buy a mycorrhizal fungi inoculant, but these fungi require
					certain conditions to thrive in the soil. They need:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A pH close to neutral.</li>
					<li>Low salt content.</li>
					<li>A balance of soil nutrients.</li>
					<li>Oxygenated soil.</li>
					<li>Minimal chemical load in the soil.</li>
					<li>A continuing source of food.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus (formerly called Mycorr Plus) has been carefully formulated
					to create every condition needed for mycorrhizae to thrive. It
					contains 70+ strains of aerobic bacteria that:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Remediate salts.</li>
					<li>Balance soil nutrients.</li>
					<li>Help neutralize soil pH through nutrient balance.</li>
					<li>Flocculate the soil by supplying needed oxygen.</li>
					<li>Break down chemical residues in the soil.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus (my-core-plus) is a food source that helps to establish our
					microbes in the soil. Once this happens, they work hard to transform
					the soil.
				</p>

				<h2>Cooperating with Nature</h2>
				<p>
					The strength of MycorrPlus is that it creates the conditions in the
					soil needed for mycorrhizal fungi and aerobic bacteria to thrive. It
					sends a strong signal to the plant: if you sequester sugars into the
					soil, the microbes will supply you with a wonderful array of
					nutrients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without sequestration, mycorrhizae will not thrive. With it, they
					create a complex fungal organism in the soil that can change
					everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, we had three customers experiencing severe drought who
					reported that their plants remained green and growing despite very
					little rain.
				</p>
				<p>
					These farmers had one thing in common—they used MycorrPlus to get
					mycorrhizal fungi functioning in their soil. The bacteria in the soil
					used the residue of the sequestered sugars as gums and glues to bind
					soil particles together.
				</p>
				<p>
					This process highly structured their soil, filling it with air
					pockets. When it rained, water soaked into these pockets and was
					stored; when things became dry, these farmers still had good moisture.
				</p>

				<h2>Mycorrhizae Benefits</h2>
				<p>
					When you get mycorrhizae working for you, everything in the soil
					improves. Mycorrhizae create a highway in the soil—they carry sugars
					from the roots to feed soil bacteria and fungi. As the bacteria digest
					calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients, the mycorrhizal
					hyphae transport them up to the plant. They also transport moisture
					stored deep in the soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					One specialty of mycorrhizae is their ability to transport
					phosphorus—a nutrient normally immobile in the soil. With carbon
					sequestration kicked into high gear and mycorrhizae filling the soil,
					far less phosphorus or potassium is needed.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section className={styles.section}>
				<h2>Balancing Soil pH</h2>
				<p>
					The bacteria in MycorrPlus help bring balance to soil nutrients,
					including hydrogen. In many cases, potential hydrogen (pH) will come
					into balance without the need for additional lime or sulfur. Give
					MycorrPlus a few months and see if your pH improves.
