					Successful farming is about getting a good return on investment – both
					of time and money. It can be very discouraging to invest in inputs but
					then not see any change.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of our customers told me that for 3 years he put out the trace
					minerals recommended on his lab report, but even after the third year,
					the level of these minerals in the soil had not improved.
				</p>
				<p>
					In previous years, our company sold fish, kelp, humic and fulvic
					acids, carbon, a biological, and liquid calcium. Although these are
					all good products, many times our customers could not afford to put
					out the amount needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Praise God, MycorrPlus (formerly named Mycorr Plus) is different. It
					is affordable – and farmers really seem to like the results. They love
					to share with me the differences they see. They keep buying it and
					telling their friends about it!
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2017, farmers bought five times more MycorrPlus than they bought in
					2016; in 2016 they bought five times more than in 2015. That means
					that in 2017 we sold 25 times more than we did in 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					I truly believe that MycorrPlus is a product just waiting to be
					discovered. Once farmers see what it does, they want to tell their
					neighbors – and over 30 have even expressed an interest in being a
					dealer.

				<h2>A Customer in Virginia</h2>
				<p>
					Recently, I spoke with one of our customers in Virginia. He said his
					grass is more vigorous, the leaves have a gloss to them, and his grass
					just looks healthier. Also, his clover is doing better.
				</p>
				<p>
					He explained that on the ends of the rows where he put down double the
					amount of MycorrPlus, his grass was a foot taller, and all his grass
					is growing back fast.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only did he buy MycorrPlus again in 2017 (a repeat customer), but
					he also contacted a fertilizer company suggesting they add MycorrPlus
					to their product line – he even referred a friend!
				</p>
				<p>
					In June, he came to our warehouse in Georgia to pick up another 13
					buckets. He even joked with my son Andrew about our “secret
					ingredient.”
				</p>

				<h2>The Future of Farming</h2>
				<p>
					The man told Andrew, “It is the future of farming.” I believe he is
					right. MycorrPlus is an opportunity for farmers to greatly enhance
					their soil with minimal investment.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It helps to kick carbon sequestration into high gear.</li>
					<li>This highly structures the soil.</li>
					<li>
						It helps to balance calcium, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil –
						making available some of the great wealth that is already there,
						saving a ton on fertilizer.
					</li>
					<li>It helps the soil utilize moisture more efficiently.</li>
					<li>
						It frees up trace minerals in the soil – within months you can see
						these levels come up on a soil test, saving money when you don’t
						have to apply extra trace minerals.
					</li>
					<li>
						Within a few months after application, many customers start seeing
						yield increases, which only improve with time!
					</li>
					<li>It can help to decrease weed pressure.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Success Stories &amp; Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					One of our customers in Wisconsin reported that his rutabagas have
					grown huge – one weighing 5 pounds! He’s even showing them to his
					neighbors to demonstrate what Mycorr Plus (MycorrPlus) can do. Many
					farmers have noted that Mycorr Plus produces huge root mass on a
					variety of crops including soybeans, grass, corn, and wheat. A huge
					root structure not only increases yields but also makes crops more
					nutrient dense, thanks to the balanced soil nutrients and GroPal sea
					minerals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Successful farming is all about return on investment. When you invest
					wisely in your soil, even though it may take some time to see the
					results, you are transforming your soil for the better. As Galatians
					6:9 says, “in due season we will reap if we do not lose heart.” Keep
					investing in your soil, and good results will come!
				</p>

				<p>
					Mycorr Plus is like a center pivot for dryland farmers – it replaces
					LIME and other fertilizers, and its lab tests show that within only 5
					months, the NPK and trace minerals in the soil significantly increase.
