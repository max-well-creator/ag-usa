					Successful farming is about getting a good return on investment – both
					of time and money. It can be very discouraging to invest in inputs but
					then not see any change.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of our customers told me that for 3 years he put out the trace
					minerals recommended on his lab report, but even after the third year,
					the level of these minerals in the soil had not improved.
				</p>
				<p>
					In previous years, our company sold fish, kelp, humic and fulvic
					acids, carbon, a biological, and liquid calcium. Although these are
					all good products, many times our customers could not afford to put
					out the amount needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Praise God, MycorrPlus (formerly named GroPal Balance) is different.
					It is affordable – and farmers really seem to like the results. They
					love to share with me the differences they see. They keep buying it
					and telling their friends about it!
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2017, farmers bought five times more MycorrPlus than they bought in
					2016; in 2016 they bought five times more than in 2015. That means
					that in 2017 we sold 25 times more than we did in 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					I truly believe that MycorrPlus is a product just waiting to be
					discovered. Once farmers see what it does, they want to tell their
					neighbors – and over 30 have even expressed an interest in being a
					dealer.

				<h2>A Customer in Virginia</h2>
				<p>
					Recently, I spoke with one of our customers in Virginia. He said his
					grass is more vigorous, the leaves have a gloss to them, and his grass
					just looks healthier. His clover is also doing better.
				</p>
				<p>
					He explained that on the ends of the rows where he put down double the
					amount of MycorrPlus, his grass was a foot taller, and all his grass
					is growing back fast.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only did he buy MycorrPlus again in 2017 (a repeat customer), but
					he also contacted a fertilizer company suggesting they add MycorrPlus
					to their product line – he even referred a friend!
				</p>
				<p>
					In June, he came to our warehouse in Georgia to pick up another 13
					buckets. He even joked with my son Andrew about our “secret
					ingredient.”
				</p>

				<h2>The Future of Farming</h2>
				<p>
					The man told Andrew, “It is the future of farming.” I believe he is
					right. MycorrPlus is an opportunity for farmers to greatly enhance
					their soil with minimal investment.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It helps to kick carbon sequestration into high gear.</li>
					<li>This highly structures the soil.</li>
					<li>
						It helps to balance calcium, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil –
						making available some of the great wealth that is already there,
						saving a ton on fertilizer.
					</li>
					<li>It helps the soil utilize moisture more efficiently.</li>
					<li>
						It frees up trace minerals in the soil – within months you can see
						these levels come up on a soil test, saving money when you don’t
						have to apply extra trace minerals.
					</li>
					<li>
						Within a few months after application, many customers start seeing
						yield increases, which only improve with time!
					</li>
					<li>It can help to decrease weed pressure.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Recently, a customer in Canada said he can always grow good soybeans
					but can’t always control weeds – he happily reported that this year
					the sow thistle has diminished in his fields.

				<h2>Fertilizer vs. Soil Amendment</h2>
				<p>
					We all want a good return on investment. While fertilizer may give
					quicker results, MycorrPlus can help improve yields while transforming
					the soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are interested in both short-term and long-term results, then
					MycorrPlus may just be what you have been looking for!
