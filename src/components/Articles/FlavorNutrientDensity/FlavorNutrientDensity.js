					In the book, “The Dorito Effect: The Surprising New Truth About Food
					and Flavor,” Mark Schatzker reveals how, just like animals, our bodies
					were created with the ability to choose foods based on the nutrients
					we need.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, pregnant cows will choose clover over grass because
					their bodies need more protein. They seek out the flavors that bring
					their bodies the nutrients they need.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his book, Mark shows how artificial flavors trick our bodies into
					thinking that a food contains needed nutrients, when in fact it
					doesn’t.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before artificial flavors were introduced in the 1950’s, foods stood
					on their own nutritional merit. If a food was low in nutrition, it
					didn’t taste good, and we wouldn’t eat it.
				</p>
				<p>
					But with artificial flavors (and even “natural” flavors, which are the
					same chemicals but just arrived at through natural means), obesity has
					become a problem in our nation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Artificial flavors deceive our bodies into thinking that a food is
					chocked full of nutrients, but when we eat it, the empty calories do
					not satisfy our nutritional needs. In response, our bodies will let us
					know that they need more nutrients, so we eat more.

				<h2>We Need Nutrient Dense Foods</h2>
				<p>
					A U.S. Senate investigation revealed that “foods grown on millions of
					acres of land no longer contain enough minerals and are starving us.”
				</p>
				<p>
					According to News Canada, during the 20th century, the average mineral
					content in cabbage, lettuce, spinach, and tomatoes declined from 400
					mg to less than 50 mg.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ninety-nine percent of Americans are malnourished. Very few Americans
					have no health problems. We lack the necessary vitamins, minerals, and
					nutrients in our diet to be healthy. We grew up with these
					deficiencies, making us vulnerable to cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and
					Parkinson’s disease, just to name a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					In days gone by, farming was about growing flavorful, nutritious food.
					Unfortunately, with the advent of artificial flavors, food no longer
					needs to be nutrient dense to taste delicious, so farmers are no
					longer rewarded for growing nutrient dense foods.
				</p>

				<h2>The Need for Trace Minerals</h2>
				<p>
					Enormous amounts of research have been building for decades showing
					the connection between trace mineral deficiencies and serious
					debilitating diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Linus Pauling, a two-time Nobel prize winner, said, “You can trace
					every sickness, every disease, and every ailment to a mineral
					deficiency.” Over 5,000 clinical studies have confirmed this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The good news is, Sea-90, GroPal, and other sea mineral products, fish
					fertilizers, and kelp are growing in popularity, helping to get needed
					trace minerals back into our diets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Back in 2006 I became a US distributor for GroPal sea mineral
					concentrate. It was my goal to see nutrient density restored to our
					foods, and I did my best to encourage farmers to use it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trace minerals contained in GroPal help make foods much more
					nutrient dense, and quite a number of farmers told me how their fruits
					and vegetables tasted so much better. In farmers markets, customers
					raved about the flavor!
				</p>
				<p>
					Farmers also reported a longer shelf life, better coloration, better
					texture, and greater resistance to insects and disease. What a
					difference nutrient density makes!
				</p>
			</section>

				<h2>In 2015, Everything Changed!</h2>
				<p>
					A few years ago, I did a two-year study in Montana with GroPal on hard
					white wheat. The vitamin content of the wheat went way up, plus it
					produced 15% to 20% better yields. We milled the wheat, baked bread,
					and did a taste test—and two-thirds preferred the bread grown with
					GroPal sea minerals.
				</p>
				<p>
					From 2006 to 2015 I sold GroPal to all who would buy it. But in a
					world where the bottom dollar is king, it wasn’t easy.
				</p>
				<p>
					How can farmers be enticed to grow nutrient dense foods? By helping
					them make more money by doing so!

				<h2>Introducing GroPal Balance / MycorrPlus</h2>
				<p>
					In February of 2015 we introduced a product called GroPal Balance (now
					called MycorrPlus). It combines all the nutrient goodness of GroPal
					sea minerals with the soil transforming strength of our Soil Balance.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the addition of Soil Balance, MycorrPlus is transformed into a
					bio-stimulant. It helps to create the numerous conditions in the soil
					needed for carbon sequestration to occur. The plant sequesters sugars
					and feeds the specific microbes equipped to digest and make available
					the nutrients it needs. As the microbes make nutrients available,
					mycorrhizal fungi transport them to the plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					As microbes bring the soil into balance, pH is naturally brought into
					balance as well. Balanced pH means better nutrient uptake by the
					plant.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus makes it so much easier to grow nutrient dense crops! With
					it you can greatly improve the flavor, plus enjoy growing foods that
					are full of the nutrients needed by those who eat what you grow.

				<h2>A Message of Thanks and a Vision</h2>
				<p>
					I would like to say “thank you” to all of you who are making a
					difference in the health of our nation by growing nutrient dense
					foods.
				</p>
				<p>Now, dream with me.</p>
