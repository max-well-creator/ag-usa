			<h2>INTERVIEW: SOS – Save our Soils</h2>
			<p>
				<em>
					Dr. Christine Jones Explains the Life-Giving Link Between Carbon and
					Healthy Topsoil
				</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				To the pressing worldwide challenge of restoring soil carbon and
				rebuilding topsoil, the Australian soil ecologist Dr. Christine Jones
				offers an accessible, revolutionary perspective for improving landscape
				health and farm productivity.
			</p>
			<p>
				For several decades, Jones has helped innovative farmers and ranchers
				implement regenerative agricultural systems that provide remarkable
				benefits for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, water
				management and productivity.

				<h3>ACRES U.S.A. Interview Excerpts</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>ACRES U.S.A.:</strong> You’ve written that the most meaningful
					indicator for the health of the land and the long-term wealth of a
					nation is whether soil is being formed or lost. Yet there’s a
					widespread belief – even dogma – that the formation of soil is an
					exceedingly slow process. Some researchers accept that idea. You
					describe the formation of topsoil as being breathtakingly rapid.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>DR. CHRISTINE JONES:</strong> People have confused the
					weathering of rock, which is a very slow process, with the building of
					topsoil, which is altogether different. Most of the ingredients for
					new topsoil come from the atmosphere – carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and
					nitrogen.
				</p>
				{/* Additional Q&A content would be added here following the same pattern */}

			<section>
				<h3>How MycorrPlus-A and O Relate to the Above Article</h3>
				<p>
					The above article by Dr. Jones gives some wonderful principles for
					successful farming. Now we would like to share with you why
					MycorrPlus-A and O are so successful in accomplishing the things Dr.
					Jones talks about.
				</p>
				<h4>How MycorrPlus-A and O Facilitate Rapid Topsoil Formation</h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Jones explains that most of the ingredients for new topsoil come
					from the atmosphere. Plants utilize these elements to produce liquid
					carbon, which they exude into the soil through their roots to feed
					soil microbes. This flow of liquid carbon (sugars) is the primary
					means by which rich topsoil is formed.
				</p>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus-A and O help to improve both the soil and the plants
					growing in it by supplying a host of nutrients including a rich supply
					of trace minerals, as well as beneficial bacteria and fungi that
					create balance and high energy levels in the soil.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the microbes are fed by the plant, they in turn release nutrients
					and energy that enable the plant to sequester even more sugars into
					the soil. This mutual relationship helps plants attain their optimum
					potential.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>The Best Way to Form Topsoil</h3>
				<p>
					Many scientists have mistakenly assumed that topsoil is built solely
					through the decomposition of organic matter such as crop residues. In
					contrast, Dr. Jones points out that most elements needed to create
					topsoil are found in the atmosphere and that building new soil centers
					around carbon. Compost may help, but it is not the best way to create
					topsoil.
				</p>
				<p>
					A plant can acquire 85–90% of the materials it needs from the air to
					create liquid carbon. Soil microbes use this liquid carbon as an
					energy source to convert tied-up nutrients into available plant food
					while the sugars act as glues to form complex soil structures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once MycorrPlus is activated—with at least 1.1" of moisture and a soil
					temperature above 45°F—plants begin to secrete liquid carbon into the
					soil, and new topsoil can start forming in just a few weeks.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Benefits of Sequestering Carbon into the Soil</h3>
				<p>
					Carbon is essential for soil structuring and water-holding capacity.
					As liquid carbon streams into the soil aggregates via roots or fungal
					linkages, it enables the production of natural glues that hold soil
					particles together.
				</p>
				<p>
					This good soil structure supports nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ensuring
					that plants rarely become nitrogen deficient. With rapid carbon
					sequestering, plant growth can quickly increase.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Minimizing Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
				<p>
					Dr. Jones recommends a gradual transition from chemically intensive
					systems to those that rely on a functioning plant-microbial bridge.
					This transition might involve reducing synthetic nitrogen by 20% the
					first year, 30% the next, and 30% the third year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Foliar applications of trace minerals, such as MycorrPlus-F, can
					support the transition while maintaining soil biology. As plants
					photosynthesize faster, they achieve higher sugar content and Brix
					levels, increasing their natural resistance to pests.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why Chemical Fertilizers Slow the Soil Building Process</h3>
				<p>
					When plants obtain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash too easily from
					chemical fertilizers, they may reduce the amount of carbon they pump
					into the soil, thereby hindering the formation of new topsoil. In
					contrast, a balanced microbial system in the soil increases nutrient
					availability beyond what a standard soil test can detect.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Maintaining Soil Aggregates</h3>
				<p>
					Keeping the soil covered and avoiding tillage helps maintain soil
					microbial life and mycorrhizal fungi. Cover crops and companion crops
					are essential to prevent the breakdown of soil aggregates, which are
					vital for moisture infiltration and retention.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Avoid or Minimize Chemical Applications</h3>
				<p>
					Synthetic fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides can
					harm the soil’s biological community. Limiting these chemicals helps
					maintain the vital soil fungi and microbial networks necessary for
					nutrient uptake.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Overcoming Weeds</h3>
				<p>
					Excessive herbicide use can create bare ground that encourages weed
					growth. Allowing some weeds with deep roots to remain can eventually
					lead to better quality plants as the soil improves. Diverse,
					multi-species cover crops also help fill in soil gaps and suppress
					unwanted weeds.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>MycorrPlus-A and O: The Ultimate Soil Building System</h3>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus-A and O are the most advanced systems known for
					accomplishing carbon sequestration and building topsoil. For most
					applications, just 32 to 64 ounces per acre is all that is needed.
				</p>

					<strong>Good News!</strong> We have a product application that fits
					every budget.
