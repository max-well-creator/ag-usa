			<h1>7 Keys for Activating the Carbon Sequestration Switch</h1>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 1 - Balance the Soil</h2>
				<p>
					You want to establish the Soil Food Web in the soil. To do so, you
					need to provide a friendly living environment.
					<br />
					<br />
					- Get rid of toxins
					<br />
					- Remediate any salt buildups
					<br />
					- Restore balance to nutrients in the soil
					<br />
					<br />
					Fortunately, MycorrPlus-A and O (formerly called GroPal Balance) help
					you do each of these.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 2 - Don't Graze Grass Down Too Low</h2>
				<p>
					For pastures, grazing grass too short compromises the root system. A
					deep root system is best maintained by avoiding very short grazing.
					Rotational grazing and frequently moving cows can help preserve root
					integrity.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Sadly, in most of our agricultural soils, we have far more bacteria
					than fungi. High density short duration grazing accompanied by
					appropriate rest periods are moving soils toward fungal dominance."
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember: Fungi are important for soil carbon sequestration and
					nutrient acquisition. They are necessary for forming humus.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 3 - Diversify</h2>
				<p>
					Crop rotation helps diversify the types of microbes in the soil. Cover
					crops, for example, can help with diversification. Some plants have
					deep root systems that help take liquid carbon and structure the soil
					to new depths.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 4 - Cut Down on Chemical Applications</h2>
				<p>
					Herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides are chemicals that disrupt
					soil biology. Every chemical application tends to hinder the
					development of healthy soil. The good news is that MycorrPlus-A and O
					help break these chemicals down and replenish the soil.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 5 - Limit Cultivation</h2>
				<p>
					Tilling the soil disturbs soil life—especially fungi—and disrupts
					mycorrhizal networks that are essential for carbon sequestration.
					No-till or minimum tillage practices help preserve these networks,
					enhancing the soil’s ability to sequester carbon.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 6 - Keep the Ground Covered</h2>
				<p>
					Soil aggregates do not form in bare soil; they tend to break down,
					limiting the availability of organic nitrogen and hindering microbial
					growth. Bare soil loses moisture faster, whereas cover crops help
					conserve moisture and maintain the structure needed for effective
					carbon flow.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
				<h2>Key 7 - MycorrPlus</h2>
				<p>
					Although keys 1–6 set the stage for carbon sequestration, MycorrPlus-A
					and O are the real secret. They accomplish the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Devour toxins and remediate salts</li>
					<li>Restore balance to the soil, including pH</li>
					<li>
						Contain numerous specialized aerobic bacteria and stimulate
						beneficial bacteria, nematodes, and mycorrhizal fungi
					</li>
					<li>Feed these microbes and help them establish in the soil</li>
					<li>Raise the energy (measured in ergs) in the soil</li>
					<li>Establish extensive networks of mycorrhizal fungi</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					MycorrPlus-A and O lay the foundation upon which the other keys are
					built—establishing the conditions necessary for maximum carbon
					sequestration.
