	{
		question: "Do I need to apply MycorrPlus each year?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Applying at least 32 oz/acre annually helps transform the soil. A 64 oz application accelerates the process.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do I need to apply MycorrPlus after every hay cutting?",
		answer:
			"It’s optional. For higher yields, an extra 32 oz/acre after each cut can help, or use a 2-quart foliar treatment 7–14 days post-cut.",
	},
	{
		question: "I have almost no topsoil. Will MycorrPlus help?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Even poor soils contain bound nutrients. A 1–2 qt/acre application initiates beneficial bacterial activity to structure the soil.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which nitrogen sources work best with MycorrPlus?",
		answer:
			"Use 28% or 32% nitrogen. Always add MycorrPlus to the tank first, then water, and finally add nitrogen.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I afford MycorrPlus?",
		answer: "Absolutely! We offer application options for every budget.",
	},
	{
		question: "What microbes does MycorrPlus contain?",
		answer:
			"It contains 4 strains of mycorrhizal fungi and over 70 aerobic bacillus strains. MycorrPlus is a bio‑stimulant that nourishes and establishes a robust microbial community in the soil.",
	},
	{
		question: "My ground is dry. Can I still apply MycorrPlus?",
		answer:
			'Ideally, apply it just before a rain. Use a larger tank mix (20–40 gal/acre) or work it in with a disk (1–2" deep) to ensure it penetrates the soil.',
	},
	{
		question: "My MycorrPlus containers are bloating. What should I do?",
		answer:
			"Loosen the lid immediately to vent gases produced by the active microbes.",
	},
	{
		question: "How soon will MycorrPlus start working?",
		answer:
			'It needs 1.1"+ of moisture and a soil temperature of 40–45°F to activate. You may notice improved moisture retention in about a month, with more dramatic results in a few months.',
	},
	{
		question: "When is the best time to apply MycorrPlus?",
		answer:
			"Apply as early as possible—spring, summer, fall, or winter—when the soil is permeable. Follow our guidelines for timing after chemical applications.",
	},
	{
		question:
			"How long after applying chemicals should I wait to use MycorrPlus?",
		answer: "Wait at least 3 days, or 2 days if rain has occurred.",
	},
	{
		question: "How should I use MycorrPlus with anhydrous ammonia?",
		answer:
			"Wait 2 or more weeks after applying anhydrous ammonia, then apply 1–2 qt/acre of MycorrPlus.",
	},
	{
		question: "There are crystals in the container. What should I do?",
		answer:
			"Crystals can form from mineral precipitation. Add them to your spray tank to re-dissolve or spread them on the field.",
	},
	{
		question: "What if MycorrPlus doesn’t work?",
		answer:
			"Troubleshoot by checking:\n- Application: Was the product applied at all?\n- Technique: Follow our guidelines closely.\n- Tank Mix: Ensure no incompatible products were mixed.\n- Time: Allow sufficient time for soil transformation.\n- Storage: Verify proper storage (avoid direct sun or extreme temperatures).\n- Carry-over: Previous chemical residues may require an extra application.",
	},
