		title: "Balances soil for fewer weeds, easier kills",
		content: `Weeds are a witness of man's failure to master the soil. Various weeds thrive in drought, acidic soil, salty soil, soil that is compacted or has a lack of humus, poorly drained soil, mineral deficient soil, or soil where minerals are out of balance. (see "Weeds and What They Tell" by Ehrenfried Pfeiffer)
Crops don't do as well in these conditions and find it hard to compete with the weeds. In many cases, weeds are there to help correct a problem in the soil, and once the problem is corrected, they no longer thrive.
Activating carbon sequestration can help to correct all of the above soil problems that weeds thrive in. As soil problems are corrected, weeds can become less and less of a problem. It may take time to see the full effect of weed suppression by restoring the soil, but keep sequestering that carbon, be patient, and within a year or two you may likely see a marked decrease in weed pressure.`,

		title: "Flocculates the soil",
		content: `When the soil doesn't have air spaces, it is easily oversaturated with moisture. When weather turns dry, soil lacking structure tends to dry out more quickly.
Activating carbon sequestration helps beneficial aerobic bacteria highly structure the soil and displace disease causing anaerobic bacteria.
In oxygen rich, highly structured soil, beneficial nematodes quickly go after and displace root nibbling nematodes.`,

		title: "Better moisture retention",
		content: `As the soil becomes highly structured due to carbon sequestration, there is less and less standing water in the field. Soil becomes a "moisture bank".
For those with irrigation, it can take 2/3rds the irrigation water to grow a crop, since available moisture is handled so much more efficiently by the soil.
Our customers note that when they get a hard rain, there is much less water standing in the field, and each year the absorption of water into the soil improves.`,

		title: "Nitrogen fixing bacteria produce lots of nitrogen",
		content: `As carbon sequestration is activated, air flows down into the soil. MycorrPlus contains nitrogen fixing bacteria that takes nitrogen in the air and converts it into urea.
Other types of bacteria take over the work and convert urea into an organic form that will not leach out or wick off.
Once the nitrogen fixing process is well established, most crops should have no lack of nitrogen.`,

		content: `When human beings breathe, we exhale carbon dioxide and water. This is why we can breathe out and fog our eyeglasses in order to clean them.
In much the same way, as the anionically charged bacteria in MycorrPlus respirate, they apparently leave a trail of carbon dioxide and water as they move through the soil.
This could, in fact, help to explain why some of our customers report good soil moisture that can't be accounted for by rain.
If you have a scientific mind and would like a more in-depth explanation of how our bacteria convert oxygen and ammonia into H20, just call and we will do our best to explain it.`,

MycorrPlus introduces these to the soil, and then activates the carbon sequestration switch.
Once carbon sequestration is activated, mycorrhizal fungi networks greatly expand and help to supply nutrients and water to the plant.`,

		title: "Less attacks by insects and disease",
		content: `Most soils today have a severe shortage of trace minerals. This negatively affects the soil's ability to trigger carbon sequestration by the plant.
Therefore, supplying needed trace minerals is an intrinsic part activating carbon sequestration.
Trace minerals also play a role in MycorrPlus's success in triggering massive amounts of sequestered carbon.
These trace minerals help to produce healthy plants and healthy livestock.
They can also result in less insect pressure. As plants are more nutritionally balanced, they become less of a target for sapping insects.`,

		title: "Balanced soil pH",
		content: `Carbon sequestration and restoring balance to the soil always go hand in hand. Balancing the soil is a means of getting plants to sequester carbon, which in turn helps to bring greater balance to the soil.
Restoring a balance to nutrients in the soil in the best and most cost-effective way to balance soil pH.
Although lime is typically used to increase soil pH, a lot of the time there is already enough calcium in the soil. Why not just free it up?
Also, sulfur gets tied up when lime is applied.
MycorrPlus is the best way we know of to both activate carbon sequestration and restore soil balance (resulting in near neutral soil pH).`,

		title: "A bounty of available plant food",
		content: `When plants start to sequester sugars to feed soil microbes, the "chemists of the soil", they respond by turning nutrients that have been tied up in the soil into available plant food.
The plants feed the microbes, then the microbes feed the plant. This is a system that our Creator put in place, and it is a good one.
When we choose to bypass soil microbes and feed the plant directly with water soluble fertilizers, these microbes can't build the soil. Carbon sequestration can really solve a lot of problems, if we work with it.`,

This can build organic matter in the soil up to 10 times faster than green manure, crop residue, mulch, compost, and any other method.
One farmer, whose only means to build topsoil was Soil Balance (the soil amendment in MycorrPlus), saw his organic matter go from 0.4% to 4.7% in just 8 years.
On the other side of things, applying a lot of nitrogen will burn up organic matter.`,

We try to increase organic matter through cover crops, crop residue, mulch or compost. Although these are all good, the organic matter they produce tends to disappear in a matter of years.
But with carbon sequestration, bacteria produce humus and organic matter that tends to stay in the soil for many, many years. This organic matter turns into dark, rich, new topsoil.`,

		title: "Higher test weights in grain crops",
		content: `Carbon sequestration feeds and nurtures bacteria, which are the chemists of the soil. The reason the plant sequesters sugars to feed soil microbes is because there is a pay-off.
Microbes multiply and spread throughout the soil, doing their work of freeing up nutrients that were previously not available to the plant.
With biological activity making more nutrients available to the plant, seeds become plump and heavy, full of nutrients and with a higher test weight. This also makes for better seed for sowing.`,

If your soil is structured down a foot by the end of the first year, but 1.5 feet by the end of the second year, you have just increased your water holding capacity by 50%.
Mycorrhizal fungi reach down deeper, carrying down sugars from the plant and carrying up nutrients and moisture. Bacteria then highly structure this soil, taking out hardpan.`,

Month after month, year after year microbes maintain aggregate stability and improve infiltration, but they do more than that. They stretch the boundaries of healthy soil deeper and deeper, which means that hard pan disappears! It is possible to have corn roots that reach down 6 feet or more!`,

Lime is no longer needed to balance pH. There is a huge amount of calcium in most soils that only needs to be made available.
There is a huge amount of phosphorus in most soils, and our bacteria, nurtured by plant sugars, make it available. A vast array of other nutrients are also made available to the plant.
As the plant acquires more and more resources to work with, sapping insects no longer see the plant as food and just walk away!
Harmful nematodes disappear, as good nematodes displace them.
Harmful fungus flourish in an unhealthy soil environment. As carbon sequestration and good bacteria turn this around, fungicides are no longer needed.`,

Each one has its own unique contribution to soil health. When the Soil Food Web flourishes, it has the power to create a perfect growing environment for plants.
When the Soil Food Web is functioning properly, earthworms and dung beetles will be abundant and greatly enrich the soil. Harmful soil life will be replaced by those that do better in healthy soil.`,

One dairy farmer who used GroPal (an ingredient in MycorrPlus) said that it normally took him 3 months to breed back half of his herd. But with GroPal it only took him 2 weeks. He was amazed at this.
Delayed breedbacks are especially frustrating for both dairy and cow/calf operations. Trace minerals really do make a difference in getting stronger heats and quicker breedback.`,

A few months later his veterinarian said to him, "Roger, your cows used to be some of the sorriest looking in the county, but now they look great!  What did you do?"
The only thing that Roger had done was to mineralize his grass with GroPal. When you apply MycorrPlus, you are mineralizing your crops!  Better looking cows can mean more money at auction!`,

		content: `As we burn more fossil fuels, we release huge amounts of C02 greenhouse gases that once were locked away deep inside the earth.
You don't have to agree that global warming is a problem to be able to comprehend that the continual release of more C02 from deep within the ground into the atmosphere probably isn't a good thing.
When you activate carbon sequestration in your soil, it captures a lot of these greenhouse gases and returns them to the soil.
Not only does this greatly increase organic matter in your soil, but you also become a part of the solution to greenhouse gases. If 1/3rd of the farmland in the world were to "activate the carbon sequestration switch", it would pretty much balance out the extra C02 released through fossil fuels.`,
